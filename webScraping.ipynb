phenomenal conclusion to the trilogy and Holland's best outing as Spidey yet. Starts off fun, safe and familiar and then becomes extremely emotional, satisfying and full of great callbacks. A love letter to all things Spider-Man.Tom Holland gives an incredible lead performance once again but with a lot more emotional heft this time around. Zendaya and Jacob Batalon both have perfect chemistry with Holland and are also incredible in their own ways.Benedict Cumberbatch reaffirms why he's such a good Doctor Strange with his excellent dry wit and gravitas. All the returning villains give strong performances but Willem Dafoe is definitely the standout performance with an unsettling and terrifying presence.Jon Watts' direction is superb, the action sequences are thrillingly acrobatic once again, there's a few homages to the styles of the previous iterations and some gorgeous images. It's also perfectly paced with none of its roughly 2hr 30 minute runtime feeling dull or overly long.The CG is extremely impressive with next to no weak spots. The music by Michael Giacchino is fantastic, a nice balance of themes from the previous ones and use of Holland's iconic motifs which are slightly altered in ways that work.\", \"It's hard to discuss this movie and not get into the spoilers because the biggest moments of this movie necessitate ruining several of the big reveals. I loved that not everything was in the trailer and I successfully avoided reading too much about the film, which helped my enjoyment. This was the first movie I've seen in a theater since Halloween Kills, so the risk of COVID-19 and all its variants didn't keep me away* from the biggest movie of the year.This movie arrives as so many older directors gatekeep what constitutes a movie. So let me break down my opinion: movies can be anything you want them to be. There is equal room for a high end Oscar contender as there is for the junk low end world that I live in, the places where Godfrey Ho, Jess Franco and Bruno Mattei make their home.What else are comic book movies other than classical myths made with computers and no small amount of sound and fury? So yeah, this is the 27th Marvel Cinematic Universe movie and you know, you don't have to watch these movies. Hollywood -- the world -- is still making something for everyone. But for crowd-pleasing moments, the two biggest I've heard in years are when Captain America lifted Mjolnir and when one of the characters arrived in this film, a literally explosion of happiness and joy from an audience that has weathered so much in the last two years.And isn't that why movies exist? To make us feel something?No movie that I have seen in a theater in nearly a decade has elicited that emotional outburst and you know, it brought true joy to my heart. So I didn't feel silly expressing my emotions, whether they were happy when a certain legal professional made his presence known or the sadness of Dr. Strange's final words to Peter Parker.Spider-Man has always lived by the lesson that with great power comes great responsibility. He's a character informed -- in every incarnation -- by a great loss that he was at fault for and a lifetime of making up for that mistake.Yet Spider-Man: No Way Home presents us with something new. Great power with responsibility also means being better than your enemies and at times, working to make them better people and not just punching them into oblivion. The fact that antagonists can be worth saving spoke to me, someone usually given to mad revenge schemes and years of grudges. Even when doing the right thing ends up hurting you, you still can do the right thing.These are big concepts for a comic book spectacle. And this movie does what all great films should. It's stuck in my mind since I saw it and I wanted some time away from it before I wrote this. Spider-Man is the story of a bully grown up and moving past the way he was treated, often finding those bullies -- Flash Thompson, Eddie Brock -- become if not friends, certainly no longer enemies.This also gets into the Marvel idea of a multiverse, a connected web of other realities where small differences -- Disney+ set this up with What If...? And this idea will form the heart of Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness -- but the main part of this story remains refreshingly human in the midst of big ideas, strange science and concepts like how magic works.Look -- I don't have to sell you on these movies. They make so much money that they're critic proof. But I do want you to consider that even if you hate superhero movies, even if you think there are too many of them, to consider your favorite film series. What if you had more than three of the original Star Wars films and they all were progressively better? What if the last Jason, Freddy or Hellraiser movie was so much better than the original? What if James Bond got more human, more relevant and more real as the world around him became even stranger?That's what's happening here. And it's amazing.*I'm triple vaxxed, beyond fastidious about mask wearing and personal space, and rarely if ever leave my movie basement. This isn't a political statement. Viruses don't have politics and if you think they do, you can kindly never read another word that I write.\", \"It was very enjoyable to watch in the cinema. The expected theories turned out to be true. Acting was great. The script was pretty good. I will watch it for the second time) It was the best Spiderman movie in my opinion. It's also one of the best Marvel movies. Be sure to watch it in the cinema!\", 'A tough one to rate. It certainly has entertainment value, but it\\'s frustrating that it could have been so much better. On the one hand, the concept of bringing villains and other Spidermen in from alternate universes is fantastic, and it was great to see some of these characters again. There is so much star power in the cast here, and the special effects are wonderful.On the other hand, there is quite a bit of bloat as well. I\\'m all for character development and non-action scenes in action movies, but too often these moments were poorly written and bogged the film down. I have to say, I didn\\'t care for how naïve Tom Holland\\'s version of Spider-Man was either, and I could never buy in to the concept that he would try to \"fix\" the villains before sending them back to their own universes. This seemed asinine to me, and how that would stop them from dying where they came from was a mystery too. There are several other plot elements that are either weakly crafted (Dr. Strange getting trapped by some quick Spidey-math) or boring (Peter Parker and his friends and their college admission drama, good grief). Give me more of the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), less of Ned Leeds, the goofy sidekick.', \"Peter is back! Everyone knows who he is and that's the problem! This is a fantastic spiderman movie, no.. this is the ultimate Spiderman movie. This was such an experience i honestly felt like a kid again. I can't believe they returned! I was so happy to see my childhood come to life.This was a incrediblely told story about The 3 peters and how deep responsibility truly is, I'm shocked with excitement in we had the great men themselves return to their respective roles which included Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Jamie Foxx, Thomas Haden church and many more. I've always been a massive fan of Tobey & Andrew so seeing them come back was the ultimate time of my life. I loved every second of it, i wanted to review this with no spoilers but that is literally impossible ao i now have +1 Spoiler review.There were so many nods and callbacks to the past which i thoight went very well & Garfield finally avenged not saving gwen!Highly Recommend! A Must See!!! 11/10.\", \"This is a movie made purely to satisfy the fans and there should be no doubt about that. No Way Home, in my opinion, is even better than Homecoming and Far From Home, and pretty much one of the best MCU movies of all time. It's a simple story, but the execution is fantastic. Even the smallest of surprises have a huge impact, and I could feel that in the theatre as I joined several other Spider-Man fans cheer out for both heroes and villains. The action sequences were brilliant; seeing them in 3D is totally worth the price of admission. Every actor delivered a believable, realistic performance, and especially our lead actor Tom Holland. The visual effects too were top notch and the editing was stupendous. Two and a half hours flew by real quick while watching this popcorn action entertainer. It won't be fair to reveal anything, so here I conclude my review, and recommend you to check out this new world of Spidey-ness on the big screen and in 3D. And once you've seen it, please don't spoil it for others, just like you won't want it spoiled for yourself.\\n                \\n                    387 out of 607 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

And -Speaking- of which, in our -{ OWN }- breathtakingly ravishing universe unfortunately, that particular proposition is likely to be a -FAR CRY- at best ; given the Academy\\'s characteristic, and seemingly perpetual \"Stiff Upper Lip\" type of attitude towards the \\'Superhero-Supervillain\\' genre, in general. However ; with \\'Black Panther\\' ( 2018 ) and \\'Joker\\' ( 2019 ) having -BOTH- been nominated for \"That... -{ Most }- Coveted Cinematic Prize ...Of All \", the Best Picture Oscar ; I believe that things are, thankfully 🙏, albeit -{ Slowly }-, changing for the better.Yeah, so I\\'m er, \"Officially\" dubbing this \"An Easter ( - E g g - ) Movie Released At Christmas\", because it -well and truly- does reveal itself as \"The Movie Of A 1,000 Beautiful Surprises\" . . . . and so much, much, much, more. { And as I recently changed my review classification from \\'spoiler-free\\' to \\'spoiler\\', my Featured-Quote does, of course, contain a glaring \"Little\" reference to ( one ) of the two MOST-THRILLING surprises of the picture ( by far ) }. In a nutshell, at this point, I suppose that it would be, well... -{ Suffice for me to say }- ...that NWH \"far, far, far, far\", surpassed my Hopes for said Theatrical \\'Gargantuar\\' . . . . and \"then some\". It has -{ already }- SMASHED \"all manner of records\" the world over, & is currently the 6th Biggest Box-Office Earner ( E v e r ) ; -quite possibly- soon to be Number 5 ( 💣 💥❗) ; after barrelling thru to overtake yet -Another- \\'Veritable Marvel Collosus\\', \\'Avengers: Infinity War\\' ( 2018 ).Right, and -these- were my three biggest takeaways: 1. The \"Raw, -{ Unbridled }- Talent\" of NWH\\'s three ( principal ) youngsters, Tom, Zendaya & Jacob . . . & boy, can the young thespian Mr. Thomas Stanley Holland, ( still barely all of \\'25 and two-thirds\\' ), Really, Really ACT 👏❗2. How brilliantly -{ ALL }- the \\'Multitudinous Trappings Of Contemporary Fame\\', ( whether that fame be positive -Or- adverse ), were depicted at the onset of NWH. 3. The totally \"Astonishing\" standard of -{ All }- of The Special Effects ( both computer generated -as well- as \"Live\" ), & indeed . . . Just the { \" A l l - A r o u n d \" } level of cinematic accomplishment by Jon Watts, Daren Gilford, & Mauro Fiore, ( Director, Production Designer, Cinematographer ), & the -{ Entirety }- of the picture\\'s CREW & CAST, frankly ....in achieving this thru the -{ Heights }- of a global pandemic.... K u d o s 🌠❗Summation: Just before I go, I feel like I -{ Must }- say this. \"If, ( -like yours truly- ), you\\'ve been a Loyal, Loving Adorer of the web-slinger for ( pretty much ) your -Entire- life . . . Bring TWICE the amount of tissues ; 1 half for the ( -Several- ) Ribtickling \\'Funnies\\' in NWH, & the other half for the richly soulful & -{ FABULOUSLY HUMAN }- emotional scenes that you are unquestionably going to encounter.

Despite the many technical problems of the movie, it is done with so much heart, that it becomes a real declaration of love to the Spider-Man character. In fact all the flaws are overwhelmed by the emotions that this movie arouses in the fans, who are cuddled and put on a pedestal by all the fan service present in the movie that leverage our nostalgia.\\n                \\n                    16 out of 20 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Why? Solely for entertainment purposes, because Marvel Studios does make rather impressive movies, now don\\'t they? Indeed. And that is also why I opted to sit down and watch the 2021 movie \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" here in 2022.Actually, my family went to watch \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" back in 2021 when it was out in the cinema, but I didn\\'t go, as I don\\'t think superhero movies are worth the ticket admission for a cinema. So instead, I opted to watch it when it became readily accessible at the comforts of my home.Writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers actually put together a wholesome enough storyline here for this movie, and sure it was watchable and enjoyable. Outstanding or memorable? No, not so much. But then again, I am not overly keen on the whole superhero genre. But \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" did provide me with entertainment for the 148 minutes that the movie ran for.And it was actually fun enough to watch the various Spider-Men come together on the screen and fight the villains from previous movies all over again. Nostalgia? Perhaps. But at the same time, sort of lazy writing when you think about it.Visually then \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" was phenomenal. But then again, that is what Marvel Studios excel at, isn\\'t it?\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" certainly has a impressive cast list, with a lot of big names. I mean, you have Tom Holland, Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire as the Spider-Man, and then you have Jamie Foxx, Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, Rhys Ifans and Thomas Haden Church return to reprise their former villainous roles. And the movie also have the likes of talents such as J. K. Simmons, Marisa Tomei, Jon Favreau and such on the cast list as well.It was nice, though, to see that the writers were taking the many previous movies in the franchise with a grain of salt some times throughout the course of the movie, with the puns and snazzy dialogue hinting at and referencing previous movies.\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" definitely is a pleasing movie for the fans of superhero movies and of \"Spider-Man\" in general.My rating of \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" lands on a six out of ten stars.', \"This movie is pure fanservice, but it (mostly) feels earned and true to what the original films they're pulling from. It never feels like it's butchering the classic characters to fit them within the MCU, and even though some are underutilised, they always do the characters justice.\\n                \\n                    18 out of 23 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Do a review yourself :-)I've seen every MCU and DC movies in theaters and i was surprise by the film. One of the 3 superheroes movies of all time on my board.We see a lot of caracters evolve and the movie takes time to set each one in the story.Full of action scenes of different types from one another. Escape the crowd, escape the magician, run from vilains, fight the vilains, save the world.The visual effects are great. The combat scenes takes the best of all spiderman movies and benefits from it.

It was a complete movie. I really liked the role of Spider-Man's friends. When I saw Spider-Man that appeared in the first part, I was very sad because it was one of the best parts in this series. I recommend everyone to watch it as soon as possible.\", \"*SPOILER ALERT!!!* READ AT UR OWN RISKwoahh!!! It was such a good experience..... laugh, joy, tears, excitement, oh my god it was just AWESOME!!!I was really excited to go to the movie when it first released in India but screw the tickets ....they were sold out.And then I went to the movie today, It was the first time i shouted and yelled and was excited in the theatre... there were applauses, cheers which i first time ever witnessed in my life in a movie theatre.Coming to the movie it starts exactly at that second where spiderman far from home ended..\\npeter is exposed as spider man to the whole world as a villain and faces legal trouble and is constantly followed by the authorities... and then decides to start a new life with MJ and Ned and apply to MIT and do not get admission into the college... Peter then comes to Dr. Strange and asks to fix what Mysterio revealed the world that he is spider man.... Then strange casts a spell(i really don't know the strange name of it). Peter messes up and strange contained the spell and threw spiderman out of the sanctum.Peter goes to the MIT chancellor and convinces her for a second chance... just then Dr. Otto Octavius comes nd screws up the scene finally he, the lizard, electro, sandman are now in the wizard's dungeon..Strange finally finds a solution to reverse the spell and send back to their worlds and spidey does not come in terms with strange... and fights with him(finally peter wins).And peter fixes otto and promises to fix others but then the green goblin turns onto peter and sadly he kills May...(it was really tearful).While Ned and MJ worry about peter and Ned uses strange's sling ring\\nand calls peter and guess what peter comes but this time it is *Andrew Garfield*!!!!(oh my god the the theatre was on fire with the yells). And then Ned calls peter again and this time its *Tobey*(again people were not in their seats even me). Then the show begins...it was a really good fight and the box that should reverse the spell was destroyed by the goblin... then peter(tom holland) asks Strange to cast a new spell where everyone would forget who peter parker is... it was a tearful goodbye..\\nAhhh!! Everyone is back to their respective universes and peter is all alone in a rented apartment and continues his duties as spiderman. He visits may's grave and talks to Happy.He tries to reconnect with MJ and Ned but takes aback knowing the danger coz of him and his spidey profession. Then the post credits shows us the venom also transported to his universe.It was so good believe me u would regret if ur not watching in the theatres.... And its the best marvel movie ever!!!!!\", \"This movie completely blew me away. I had been following the rumor mill and hype train for this movie for awhile now, and it still exceeded my expectations. This movie had so many ways that it could've been a mess, but it managed to handle everything perfectly. The first act was definitely a little all over the place, but once the spell went haywire, the movie kicked into high gear.Doc Ock showing up on the bridge and having his fight with Peter was excellent, and the little tease of Green Goblin was great too. Doc Ock looks identical to his Spider-Man 2 appearance, which still boggles my mind. The way that the spell worked and the way it pulled villains in made much more sense than it seemed in the trailers. Basically, everyone who know Peter was Spider-Man before should still know as opposed to just dead villains. From here, the whole chase after the villains was great, especially the sequence with Electro and Flint, who was just so confused. Then comes Norman Osborne, who absolutely stole this movie. Willem Dafoe knocked it out of the park as the Goblin, truly making him feel like the Joker of Spider-Man.The fight at the condo was excellent, and the way Norman just kept going and going was nuts. The death of Aunt May was absolutely heart breaking, and allowed for our Peter to go through an incredible arc. Then came the other Spider-Men. I love the way they were introduced, and the theater went WILD! Both Tobey and Andrew knocked it out of the park, especially Andrew. His character wasn't great in TASM (in my opinion), but he was great in this movie. One of the most entertaining, scene-stealing characters of the film. I love how they recreated the Spider-Men pointing at each other meme in a way that didn't feel forced. Any scene with the 3 Spider-Men was perfect, and absolutely legendary. So many iconic moments, especially the three swinging out and landing to face the villains. This final fight was just incredible, with so many call-backs and great moments. Andrew's Peter saving MJ was one of the most emotional moments of the whole movie, allowing that Peter to finally give himself some forgiveness for Gwen's death. The way the fight ended, with Peter (Tom) nearly killing the goblin, only to be stopped by Tobey's Peter was perfect, as it showed Peter (Tom) the true Spider-Man way.The way the movie ended was purely heartbreaking, with Peter having to say goodbye to the other Peters, and his best friends. This ending sets Peter (Tom) up to finally be on his own. Nobody knows who he is, so he's gonna have to start over and keep on going. I also love the way that Peter's new suit looks, with the bright blues and bright reds, it looks incredible.All in all the film blew me away, definitely becoming one of the greatest films of all time. I cannot wait to see what's next for Spider-Man.\", \"Remember when critics said there were too many villains in the third installment of the Raimi trilogy?

This is the Infinity War equivalent for the Spider-Man movies, it\\'s the most ambitious cross-over in the history of Spider-Man, and honestly, the most ambitious cross-over since Infinity War.Insane cast, Willem Dafoe brings an Oscar-worthy performance, Tom Holland and Marisa Tomei both bring their dramatic A-game, Toby Maguire and Andrew Garfield reprising their roles with heartfelt intensity, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx are incredible antagonists (though as far as villains go, Dafoe steals the show, just as Garfield does for the good guys).Insane fan service. Great intro of Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock in official MCU capacity. Fantastic way to bring back Garfield and Maguire. Great choice of villains, even if the 6th member of the Sinister Six was getting drunk in Mexico. We finally get an official \"With great power, comes great responsibility\". Nice meme material, \"You know, I\\'m something of a scientist myself\" and \"my back\". The fan service here didn\\'t feel forced.Great action. CGI wasn\\'t the best the MCU has to offer, but absolutely gets the job done. I think as the Dr. Strange\\'s skills as a sorcerer have improved, so too have the creativity of the visuals used to depict his spells. Very fresh feel of the mirror dimension this time around, looking forward to seeing it again in the next Dr. Strange film.Most of all, it\\'s a great story. The character growth is dynamic and well paced. It happens on all facets and it\\'s very clear that the writers and Jon Watts have taken to heart criticism of the first two MCU Spider-Man films. There\\'s the heart-wrenching loss of Aunt May (never gets easier to see any Spider-Man losing someone), a serious stepping up of Tom Holland\\'s Peter Parker to be more than just an Iron Man Jr., and an apologetic reminder that Parker is broke (and not a Stark trust fund kid), both during the movie and once again at the end, when his slate is wiped clean. Garfield gets a chance to save Holland\\'s MJ in a very dramatic mini-\"redemption arc\". The best part of the script is the motif that Spider-Man\\'s best attribute is his incredible moral compass, and great moral strength, willing to take on all the pain and sacrifice so that his friends and neighborhood can live on prosperously even if he gets left behind. It\\'s an echo that establishes the Spider-Man at the end of the film as a spiritual successor to Capt. America more strongly than it does as an Iron Man Jr. The growth that Maguire and Garfield\\'s Spider-Men bring in helping Holland\\'s Spider-Man realize that vengeance is not what Aunt May would have wanted, and by extension, is not the Spider-Man way is incredibly touching and a fantastic dynamic for the three Spider-Men. Toby Maguire\\'s goodbye in the movie \"You know. It\\'s what we do\" to Tom Holland is a great send-off and acknowledgement that the mantle of Spider-Man is never an easy one to wear, but it\\'s one that Spider-Men in every universe wear with great power and responsibility.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a tale of sacrifice, growth, and redemption. Say what you will about the quantity of the MCU, but the quality of select films like Spider-Man: No Way Home is undeniable, and I hope this isn\\'t the last time we see an adventure as epic as this was.', 'Not Just A Film, But A Tribute To Every Spiderman Fan... Big Thanks To Marvel & Sony For Bringing Back Tobey Maguire... I Laughed, Cried & Felt Proud Of Spideys... A Must, Must Watch!', 'Spider-man has been my all-time favorite superhero since I was a kid; to be more precise, Tobey Maguire was the only real spider-man for me and I was never able to even have the slightest interest for Andrew Garfield\\'s spider-man. I remember wearing his suit when I was five or six years old after watching the Sam Raimi\\'s trilogy for the 100th time and pretending that I was the friendly neighborhood spider-man. Who knows, maybe my passion for science came from these movies, cause you know, I\\'m something of a scientist myself. All these memories came rushing back to me after I heard the rumors about the possibility of multiverse in the new movie. I did not care if they would vitiate my good memories because of an awful storyline, all I needed was to see Tobey wearing his unique costume one more time. The moment he walked into the scene for the first time after fourteen years, the lyrics from \"No leaf clover\" by Metallica came to my mind: \"Good day to be alive Sir!\".I loved everything about the movie and I really appreciate the fact that the producers gave us another chance to see our beloved heroes and it even surpassed my expectation. Although, I would like to mention some of my opinions that I believe could make the perfect movie. The introduction of other Spider-men into the scene for the first time could have been way more exciting, however, it still did not stop the audience from expressing their huge emotions including myself. On the other hand, green goblin seemed so desperate in the first scenes before turning into the marvelous villain that we used to know. Moreover, I was expecting to see more fights between Doc Ock and Tom Holland when they met but apparently that scene was only made for the trailer to distract us from thinking about three Spider-men.Dialogues and interactions between characters were purely hilarious, not to mention the references to the old movies which have turned into memes nowadays. To be honest, I kept waiting for the moment to hear Tobey say \"I\\'m gonna put some dirt in your eye\", but I suppose that is never going to happen again.Right after the movie ended, I thought to myself how they can make another new MCU movie better than this one, because for me, this movie was the closest thing to an ideal movie after Sam Raimi\\'s version. I have a feeling that spider-man (Tobey\\'s) has shaped my personality and it has been a part of me for as long as I can remember, therefore, if I have to, I will wait another fourteen years to see him again, regardless of the story.', 'This was just perfect.

I kind of hate the idea of delving too deep into a multiverse, because I think it muddles things too much, and defies the internal logic of most stories. Sure enough that was something I felt while watching this film. This movie cannot hold up to even the tiniest bit of analysis, because it creates plot holes that you can drive a freight train through. It\\'s kind of sad because there were some moments in the movie that I genuinely loved, but all I can think about days later are the myriad of questions that I\\'m left with because this movie created so many situations that make no sense.My other big problem with Spider-Man: No Way Home is not really a fault of the movie, but more of the society we live in today. Living in an internet-focused culture, we are bombarded by ads and news stories that relate to the things that interest us. SInce I\\'ve shown my love for all things MCU in the past, of course I see plenty of things crossing my radar about the upcoming films. I was able to avoid watching any trailers for this movie, which I thought would help, but by merely catching headlines of casting rumors I could foresee every surprise they built into it. Of course any logical mind could put two and two together once the guest appearances start, so I suppose this isn\\'t a movie that is going to blow away audiences with its surprises.As I said, though, my disappointment is quite frustrating because I also found many aspects of No Way Home so satisfying. They wrapped up some story elements nicely, and this might have contained some of the best acting in any Marvel movie. In particular, I found Zendaya so surprisingly strong, I was almost able to ignore her lack of character motivation in some key moments. She wasn\\'t the only person in the film that behaved stupidly, in fact the central premise of the film is built on a horrible idea from Aunt May that seems altruistic, but lacks any 4th-dimensional thinking which I would expect from a genius like Peter Parker. But smart people being dumb is the catalyst of the entire story, as even Dr. Strange doesn\\'t seem to think anything through, past Peter\\'s initial request.No Way Home is easily the most meta Spider-Man movie ever made, which is kind of shocking to say in a post \"Into the Spider-verse\" world. It\\'s catering to the most die-hard fans in the world, but it\\'s more of a nod to the fans of the Spider-Man movies. I was always a huge fan of the multitude of Spider-Man comic books when I was a collector, but I\\'ve typically struggled with his portrayal in films. So, giving all these nods to things that came before Tom Holland took over the role on the big screen, falls a bit flat for me. One of the things I loved about this iteration of the character is that it avoided the cliches and saved us so much of the traditional Spider-Man origin story, but this movie back-pedaled and became a copy of a copy of a copy.This return to cliche also sucked some of the emotion out of key moments as any fan of the character should know the same old tropes by now. I almost got emotional at the end because of the great acting performances, but the big emotional moment earlier in the film did nothing for me as all I could think was \"really, we\\'re going there?\" There are some good laughs in the film, although I wonder how well it will hold up on rewatch. And I will rewatch this film, as I do with all MCU movies, but I think at this point Spider-Man: No Way Home sits as my least favorite in the franchise. In fact, I\\'m at a point right now where I\\'m questioning if I will keep being a diehard fan of everything the MCU churns out. This film wasn\\'t what I\\'d call a complete failure, but I\\'m concerned the MCU is getting closer to one of those. Perhaps EndGame should have been exactly what the title implies.', \"Spider-Man - No Way HomeThis was clearly a pandemic disaster, I am at a loss to say much good about it.The problemsA tissue thin story entirely built upon people knowing Spider-Man identity.No proper antagonistTotally contrived in bringing previous characters back for no proper reason.A total lack of emotional intelligence, a viewing audience goes through emotions in response to a story, not following someone saying goodbye and then playing some emotional music.Overly CGI'd, and so many things stolen from other movies.A total lack of humour, if there was a joke it went flat!Overall it was truly dreadful from start to finish and everyone around did not say a single good thing.

Now I have watched it, here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees Spider-Man's secret identity revealed, he tries to get Doctor Strange's help to fix things but this leads to some unwanted visitors from other universes to cause problems for both of them.Main Character\\nTom Holland has played Spider-Man for a while now and for me this is his best performance in the role. You really see how he has grown and this film shows real depth to the character and how he has kind of grown up into this crazy world. He doesn't have much rest in the film and it really pushes Holland to impress in the majority of his scenes and I thought he was great in really making Spider-Man a top hero in The MCU.Supporting Characters\\nZendaya plays MJ and I was just really happy to see the dynamic between her and Peter in this film. Despite everything that goes on they are a pretty strong couple and it is just nice for a comic book film to have a relationship that feels natural without overpowering the main plot. Benedict Cumberbatch reprises his role as Doctor Strange and he is really good, I really like how despite being a hero he has a more mature and different viewpoint to Spider-Man. He adds some really interesting parts to the film and plays a unique role in the progress of the story and Spider-Man as a character. Jacob Batalon is back as Ned and he is much better then the role he played in Far From Home. He is just a fun character that supports Peter, he is way more involved with Spider-Man and that improves his character so much. Marisa Tomei is back as Aunt May and again she is more involved this time out and is just a really great person for Holland to bounce off and the dynamic just really works and makes their relationship feel very real. Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina and Jamie Foxx reprise their roles as Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Electro. Dafoe and Molina are great and really flourish in their roles, but the surprise is Foxx as Max Dillon/Electro. He is so much better then he was in Amazing Spider-Man 2 and I am glad he got given this 2nd chance here.Story\\nThe story is really great, I was worried with all of the multiverse elements that the focus could have been taken off of a character arc for Spider-Man but it nails this element. Peter has a real arc and it develops incredibly well and for me was a real highlight. It is obviously great seeing the returning villains and they are treated with respect and their characters are further explored. The ending feels deserved and because you are so invested it feels really earnt.Script\\nMCU films often get criticised for their scripts including too much humour in them, but I actually think the balance is really handled well here. Yes there are funny moments here but for me they didn't outweigh the serious and darker parts of the film.Style\\nThe film looks great, the actions scenes are all really fun and seeing The MCU Spider-Man going against villains from the other franchises works very well and allows for some fun sequences. The pacing for the film is also really good, despite being 2 hours 30 mins it never felt too long and I honestly believe that there isn't really any filler here which is an impressive feat.Overall\\nOverall, Spider-Man: No Way Home is an epic film that really lives up to the hype. I am possibly still buzzing because I have just watched the film but I can't find too much fault and this is a Spider-Man fans dream film and anybody will find this film plenty of fun.Rating - 10/10.\", 'This movie is a next level Marvel movie.

It had already established Spider-man characters with no involvement with Stark, but still failed at making Tom\\'s Peter any better than he was when under Tony Stark\\'s mentorship. This movie was not good. No amount of nostalgia saved it for me. It had pacing issues, for example the movie skimmed past Peter\\'s whole identity exposed moment and chucked Daredevil in for a meaningless cameo as nobody seemed to truly care that as a blind man, he was able to catch a brick chucked through the window. He was literally just there for fanservice, and not a well written one. The rest of the movie is pointless as by the end, they just reverse everything by sending the spider-men and villains back to their world, after of course, seemingly retconning the plots of the previous spider-man movies by curing the villains, who were taken before they met their demise. Therefore their fights with spider-man end on a lame note as they all just become ordinary men towards the end of the original battles and so the Peter Parkers wouldn\\'t experience the key character development and progression of their stories from this.And in usual MCU fashion, the film is riddled with jokes that sometimes hit, but mostly fall flat. Awful humour, which is constantly blurted out after (or during) serious moments because the writers simply couldn\\'t leave us without jokes for two whole minutes. Constant tonal shifts because of the \"jokes\", And the Peters just felt like they needed to be there for Tom\\'s Peter? Bad writing at its finest.Yes, this whole movie could\\'ve been avoided if Peter just listened to Doctor Strange, a man who actually knows magic and the consequences of messing spells up, but nope, he has to be stupid when he is supposed to be smart. Strange was literally the best character in the entire film, just for being the only one with a working braincell.Overall, I found this movie quite bad. Nothing about it made me want to rewatch it and I have been feeling this with MCU movies recently like Black Widow and Shang chi, I will continue to watch Spider-man movies just because of my love for the character, but I will most likely continue to think the MCU\\'s portrayal of the character is the worst even though Tom Holland\\'s acting is great.', \"The whole film was amazing didn't disappoint at all!!

When reviewing movies, pointing out gripes matters most when the gripes take away from the overall experience, I can safely say such a criterion does not apply to this movie.The biggest, most notable improvement and talking point about this movie is the story of Peter Parker and the presence of morality in this film. The events of the movie all act in service to the lesson taught to Peter Parker, and of course, the audience. We see Peter go through hardships and have the biggest role models to him tell him how and why he should still be the hero even the bad people deserve. This movie has it\\'s themes set in consequence, responsibility, and self-sacrifice. Every thing goes wrong for Peter, yet in spite of it, the right people at the right time guide him to the moral truth. This culminates at the ending, with Peter\\'s life effectively set to 0, no friends, no girlfriend, no superheroes knowing his identity. He\\'s all on his own for the first time, at his lowest point in life, but we see that he still throws on his new mask, still swings through NY, and is still Spider-Man\\'ing.Throughout the movie, the classic villains do various heinous things to him, and we see the \"Man vs. Enemy\" struggle. At various points in the movie, villains like Green Goblin, Electro, Sandman and the Lizard jeopardize the already waning stability in his life, causing Peter great stress. This, along with the low public opinion of Peter Parker causes self-conflicts within Peter. The great takeaway from this is the \"Man vs. Self\" struggle presented subtly by Doctor Strange, and upfront by Green Goblin. Green Goblin tells Peter that despite how responsible him or his Aunt May want him to be, those with power don\\'t conform to responsibility. This idea festers in his mind, which boils over at the end. Green Goblin kills his mother-figure in Aunt May, and Peter genuinely feels the desire to kill Norman Osborne, which is a VERY welcome negative-change arc for the character, considering the usual cookie-cutter every-man that MCU heroes usually are. This change leads to the other two Peters informing him on what\\'s right, which is where MCU Peter cements his instilled lessons in his mind on what a truly responsible person must be, even if he doesn\\'t want to be one. Anyone paying mild attention to the film should understand the lesson this movie presents to its cast and its audience, and should appreciate it, because it\\'s slapped on our faces and handled so well.The comedy was great, though comedy is subjective so I won\\'t delve too deep into what makes it funny. There\\'s less quirky \"high school humor\" which is refreshing because the way the characters joked and acted in the first two movies was nothing like the average high school student today. There are various callbacks, various acknowledgements of absurdity, various memes that make the jokes stick, which is welcome.The villains were magnificent. The movie doesn\\'t waste time or babysit the audience by explaining who each villain is in too much detail, and rather operates best when the supplementary movies and material are known/understood by the audience. As I said, the callbacks add to this effect, making it so that people who have these older Spider-Man movies fresh on their minds can think, \"Oh yeah, this did happen\" when something is referred to. The best thing about the presence of these villains is that they don\\'t develop a personal aggression/relationship with Peter Parker. They act as the force of change for Peter\\'s life instead, which is good because it doesn\\'t feel like it was rushing plot points, or left parts of their relationships half-baked. This movie is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, and with 5(ish) villains, I don\\'t think this movie would have benefitted from the Far From Home approach of making the beef personal. Kudos to the writers for understanding why it should be this way. The \"villain\" of this movie presents an interesting question to Peter, as they are seen numerous times doing heinous things to Peter and the world around them. That question is, \"Do the bad people deserve help?\" It\\'s easy to say no for anyone else, but for Spider-Man (all 3), the answer is yes.1. Green Goblin: Genuinely the scariest interpretation of the character yet. We see him go from looming menacing threat, to cowering old man, to genuinely frightening villain back-to-back-to-back. He ruins Peter\\'s life for literally no reason out of nowhere which worked so well in instilling fear in me. Aunt May does the right thing by offering him help, he gets taken in and helps out a bit with Peter on helping cure Doc Ock and Electro, then BAM. Crazy villain that destroys Peter in one of the most intense brawls, kills aunt May, and leaves the place smiling. Willem Dafoe cements his place as one of, if not the best Comic Book movie villain in history, as he is the first villain EVER to have me genuinely scared and heartbroken for the hero.2. Doc Ock: Doc Ock felt like a half-villain in the movie. He was like an appetizer for the fact we were getting all these old villains. His fight with Peter on the bridge was extremely fun, his humor was fun, and his insight on the multiversal situation was fun. He gets cured by Peter pretty early on, which is what people (myself included) wanted because it\\'d feel like character-robbery if Kevin Fiege just plucked him out of his universe and made him full-villain again. He then disappears, which is a gripe, but one that doesn\\'t need much explaining. He comes back, makes the save, and proves his worth as a hero.3. Electro, Sandman, the Lizard: These guys were mostly powerful punching bags for Peter, there was no personal attacks on him, just conflict and general aggression. As I\\'ve said earlier, they work to service the plot more than service the characters, which I\\'m fine with.The fights were stellar. The fight with Doctor Strange was one of the best fights in the MCU. The fight with Green Goblin at the condo, and at the end were some of the best fights in the MCU. I don\\'t need to say much more.Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield\\'s presences were VERY welcomed. Two Spider-Men were just the moral compass that Peter 1 needed to get back on track, and they have some genuinely emotional scenes together. Seeing the chemistry they all had makes me want them back in another movie, that\\'s JUST how good they were together.There\\'s so much more to cover, but I don\\'t write for Oxford. 10/10 Super Hero movie.

It\\'s been marketed as the biggest film since Endgame and well, they delivered. No Way Home will hype old fans and new fans alike. It is intense.As it\\'s still very early days of the release this is a SPOILER FREE review.TLDR at the bottom.Tom Holland has comfortably planted his feet into this role and this time round he gets to shine in his 3rd solo outing as a 17 year old with his friends going through typical situations 17 year olds and friends go through, but yaknow whilst being Spider-Man but it doesn\\'t come without its gripes. The pacing. The film starts with a fantastic opening sequence starting right where the previous film left off and we\\'re put in the middle of the chaos. Its exhilarating, frantic and well in the future it bodes well for anyone on a Spider-Man marathon. However, as soon as the opening dies down, so does the pacing. We\\'re put through slow scenes for quite some time. Long enough to say in your head \"Oh get on with it\" but short enough to say, \"To be fair, this pacing is necessary because we know it\\'s gonna be an all-out battle at the end in true Marvel fashion\". It\\'s something that works but feels uneven as we go from fast to slow to fast.Further, my gripes with most MCU films, some of the jokes fall flat. The writing here for the most part is great, nothing stand out. It fits the tone but in true Marvel fashion there\\'s moments that can break the tension because of a poorly placed joke; nothing as bad as an epic scene from GotG 2 (2017) of them getting in formation in all it\\'s epicness then getting bonked on the head, but these are more dialogue jokes that just don\\'t land. I.e., the scene shown in a trailer of Peter and Co. Making fun of Doc Ock.Speaking of the villains, one thing I feared is that we all knew the villains of previous movies would appear in this film and I had hoped that they didn\\'t diminish the core of these villains by turning them into jokes but I\\'m glad to say this isn\\'t true - for the most part. When it does happen, it\\'s a short time and it\\'s quickly followed by something grand.With all the above being said, the good stuff is great.The cinematography is noteworthy. Right off the bat you can tell that the cinematography is unlike any prior MCU Spider-Man film. Mauro Fiore, the cinematographer on films like Avatar (2009) and Training Day (2001), does a phenomenal job of putting you directly in the scene for maximum immersion. The long tracking shots allows you take in the entirety of the scene and feel the frustration or the chaos ensuing on screen, whilst the slow scaling in on shots allows you to feel the emotions the characters are going through. Fiore also knows how to make you look at a static shot in awe. The lighting, the depth of field. It looked crisp. Honestly, at times I forgot that this was part of the MCU. Overall, visually, this film was a treat to the eyes. There are sequences that are trippy, I mean Dr Strange is in this film, and there are sequences full of what you expect of a blockbuster Marvel film.The cinematography also conveyed the tone of the film. The light-hearted teenage film remains as it did in prior films but there are times where scenes play out and it gets darker, the crowd goes silent and the hairs on your arm stand up. In all solo films, this is the one that Holland gets to act his heart out. This is pushed by the fact that the narrative is more mature as it deals with moral conflict, and it does make you think about character decisions and the brutality of it depicted on screen via the acting and narrative. The storyline presents the audience with real stakes which is fuelled by the TV shows and just knowing the general direction the MCU is heading, and this real stakes thing is not something you see often in an MCU film.Whilst each scene has it\\'s action and poignant moments, it\\'s the soundtrack that highlights the scene. For the most part it blends into the background of each scene, and it emphasises the scenes\\' emotions, but in one particular instance the soundtrack was operatic and it sends chills down your spine. It was beautiful to hear.Jon Watts does a fantastic job with presenting old villains to our current cast, and I\\'m blown away at how he and the writers: Chris Mckenna and Erik Sommers manage to balance the characters out whilst still allowing us to feel the emotions that the characters go through. We don\\'t need to see development of each villain as we\\'ve already had backstories on them all, and that\\'s used to its advantage as in turn, it makes this a Spider-Man film. Watts also manages to create a fan favourite film - many times a scene would play out and, in my head, I would think \"This\\'ll be cool if this shot was next to accentuate the scene\" and boom the shot appears. He knows his audience and how to reach them, in this film more than ever.This is aided by the supporting cast. Zendaya, Jacob Batalon and Marisa Tomei play their respective roles adequately as they push Peter in his internal and external battles and act as comic relief from time to time but along with the darker tone, allows us to also get invested in them as characters and their relationships to Peter.Now how does this film fit into the MCU? Well first of all, its definitely towards the top of the rankings in the MCU films and whilst it may not set up anything, it gives us a taste of what the MCU can achieve with the multiverse. We know that\\'s coming with the upcoming Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness (2022). We have to also remember that we were all under the impression this was Tom Holland\\'s last outing as the wall crawler and if that had remained true, this film was a fitting send off.There are many surprises along the way. My eyes teared up from joy, from sorrow, I laughed, I got invested. All in all I walked out the cinema hyped so much that before I even thought about writing this review, I had to wait a day to ensure that I wasn\\'t blinded by the hype.Overall, this was a fantastic entry into the MCU and I imagine rewatching this film 10 times over would still make you feel like the first time you watched it.P. S. A massive kudos to the director, the writers and everyone that worked on this film. A film of this magnitude is difficult to pull off and daunting to say the least. The amount of expectations and hype surrounding the film before the release is one thing but to be able to pull it off on this grand of a scale and leaving fans happy is astounding.P. P. S. Now we know what they can do, bring on the X-Men & F4.At some point a spoiler review will be coming and can get into more specific things.TLDR: It\\'s a solid film and a solid addition to the MCU.', 'Marvel know how to make a good superhero movie.

They cast a spell of wiped memory and screw it up, reality is torn, familiar faces invade different spaces... you know this, you\\'ve seen the trailer. It\\'s the Sony/MCU equivalent of X-Men: Days of Future Past, with a stream of old band members coming out of retirement for a jam-packed farewell concert.One might hope that the results are a smidge better than that old X-Men reunion, and they are, but No Way Home also suffers from many of the same problems. Primarily, the overwhelming urge to stuff as much crap on the screen as possible, even when the audience is already exhausted. It tries to serve too many masters and, in the end, sufficiently serves none. There\\'s fun to be had, especially when the oddball mix-and-match super-characters get the chance to escape the trappings of a broader storyline and simply converse as individuals. Those accessible human interactions have been a big strength for the two preceding Marvel Spider-Man flicks, and they reap great benefits here, each time the old guard mingles with the new.I wish we had more such moments, but the push to turn the MCU\\'s most grounded franchise into another big-time tent pole attraction demands otherwise. In reaching for the next major event, they\\'ve overlooked the \"neighborhood\" part of \"Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man.\" Actually, they might\\'ve forgotten the \"friendly\" part, too, because there\\'s a whole bunch of angst spinning around Tom Holland\\'s central performance. But that\\'s more excusable: Peter Parker goes through a lot over the course of this hundred-fifty minutes, he progresses and matures as a character, and he\\'s experienced equally dark times in the comics.No, the performances aren\\'t the issue here, nor is the dialogue, which remains snappy and delightful. The primary culprit is the plot, bloating and careening in indeterminate (and often mindless) directions, making a lot of noise but not making a lot of sense. Dr. Strange hand-waves many explanations under the guise of mysticism, which is basically his thing, but so do the various Spider-Men. Important members of the supporting cast are marginalized and under-served. The city of New York, once an essential ingredient, is now barely a backdrop. Goalposts are moved, overshadowed, and then moved again. Rumor has it that script re-writes were still underway during filming, and it shows.This is messy. Lots of fun on certain occasions, but stifling and sludgy in others. It\\'s a mixed bag, leaning more to the positive than the negative, but I don\\'t know that I\\'m content with the way everything wraps up in the end. Where Homecoming and Far From Home both left me charged and anxious for the next step, No Way Home put me in a place of quiet acceptance.

So naturally I was expecting big things, and trust me, it didn\\'t disappoint.I found myself, throughout the film and the days after watching it, trying and failing to pin my thoughts down and give it a score out of 10. This is likely due to the amalgamation of so many previous characters, spanning from 2002-2021 through multiple movies and franchises. This was not a negative, but rather something to be very, very excited about and nervous of how it would be handled. I was scared of a clear villain not being established, however Willem Defoe\\'s Green Goblin was expertly presented as \\'the baddie\\'. Peter is haunted by him after the death of Aunt May, and his iconic, almost Joker-esque laugh gave him a real villainous tone.I can\\'t write a spoilers review without talking about the other Spider-men. The relationship between the three Peter\\'s is everything every Spider-man fan has ever wanted, from their hilarious conversations about web shooters and aliens to their instant connection over the loss of their loved ones. I could not help but laugh at the simplicity yet complication of it all, it\\'s just three different Peter\\'s, yet 20 years in the making. A side note, does this mean that the MCU started in 2002?The basic plot for this film is something new for Spider-man. And while it works very well, it did keep me asking questions about Doctor Strange\\'s abilities. Could he have made everyone forget about the clip that Mysterio made instead of listening to Peter\\'s suggestion? Surely he\\'s smart enough to know that Peter wouldn\\'t want everyone to forget? This line of logic is the main fault with this film. Specifically towards the end when every universe is about to raid Peter\\'s and he suggests to just recast the original spell. Films in which the main character suddenly comes up with some form of solution at the end undermines the entire movie.Tom Holland takes the role of Spider-man in a different way than Andrew Garfield or Tobey Maguire did. Throughout his first trilogy, he doesn\\'t \"change\" into Spider-man, he essentially stays as Peter even when he\\'s in the suit. This helped bring Peter alive and give us a much more realistic representation of the character. He also doesn\\'t have as much of a problem of balancing lives like Maguire did, or a problem with his Uncle Ben for that matter (Who isn\\'t even mentioned by Holland\\'s Parker after Maguire\\'s Parker explains how he lost him). His adorable geekiness and lovable lightheartedness make this film not only a brilliant Spider-man movie, but a brilliant Peter Parker movie too.', \"This movie is great. There is nothing more to it.

The experience of Spider-Man: No Way Home is bizarre. Not only do you spend half the runtime just waiting for the return of a familiar face, but grow weary of the current cast which've headlined the previous MCU entires. Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon cannot hope to carry a film on its own terms, therefore No Way Home relies and depends on the presence of legacy. Far From Home (2019) was borderline unwatchable. Cheap-looking, tone-deaf and accompanied by a forced, cringeworthy romance (which doesn't improve here by the way) it is surely the worst Spider-Man movie of all time. This threequel holds the unfortunate title of runner-up. It shares many of the same problems...First of all; technicalities. As with most MCU movies, the cinematography is flat and the colour palette is dulled for no apparent reason. The action set-pieces aren't very inventive and hold no iconography, always taking place on a boring, painfully obvious green-screened environment. Why does the Statue of Liberty look like that!? Why has the Lizard's design regressed from 2012, and why do they recycle and super-impose B-Roll footage of Thomas Hayden Church as Sandman, or Rhys Ifans as Curt Conners? It's so lazy.Aunt May's death barely affects me emotionally, because thus far she's been portrayed as this bubbly, whimsical character with very few scenes of actual conviction. Can you imagine if this was Rosemary Harris or Sally Fields' Aunt May? The difference in my reaction would be night and day. Moral of the story, don't cast the most gorgeous woman alive as Aunt May... Speaking of conviction, why does this film feel the need to inject a cheap gag whenever it's in proximity to a remotely serious scene? These screenwriters have to go back to basics, and refresh themselves on the fundamentals of tone. Not to mention, most of the MCU's humour so infrequently lands, and caters to the lowest common denominator audiences. That's not to say there aren't a few smart quips here or there, but for the most part, I was confused by the amount of chuckles surrounding me.No Way Home is, clinically, a bad movie. Take for instance, the First Act. Much of the world wants Spider-Man hunted down and defeated. He's interrogated once, and then freed on behalf of a pointless cameo by Daredevil himself, Matthew Murdock. Like, what? There's no ramifications. He just gets to live his life despite being an enemy of the state. Does the world think he partook in a terrorist plot or do they think he snatched a candy from a convenience store? I'm a little confused. I guess the consequence is that Ned and MJ don't get into MIT... Big deal. I don't care. These are poorly written characters. Bring on the multiverse villains!What can I say on that front..? I was grinning from ear-to-ear in seeing Dr. Octopus (Alfred Molina), Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) back again. Hearing their musical cues gave me goosebumps, as did some of their dialogues... It's a testament to the actors. There's some serious talent in The Sinister Six. I love their interactions. For a second you'll think to yourself how cool it all is, how you should just be thankful a film like this is even possible... But again, why have it at all if it isn't done correctly? Take for instance, the final battle, with one of the glaring objective errors of the film... Tobey's swingin' around, pulling off epic Spidey stunts, and there's no hint of Danny Elfman's beautiful theme... Same goes for Andrew Garfield, who had the privilege of having two great themes by James Horner and Hans Zimmer respectively. What was Michael Giacchino thinking!? He already dabbled in old themes for the villains, so why not for the heroes? If the movie is dead-set on fan-service and and legacy (which it most certainly is) then why on Earth not include these terrific tunes? Instead we just get orchestral renditions of Tom Holland's theme, which utterly PALES in comparison! It's just the same progression of notes.On to the Spider-Men themselves... Andrew Garfield has probably solidified himself as my favourite after watching this, while Tobey Maguire remains legendary by default since he was my childhood Spidey. Tom Holland doesn't come close. I never liked him in the role because he's not tangible. He's too pure and honest; thereby becoming illegitimate as a realistic humanistic interpretation. For whatever reason, Tobey Maguire gets stabbed, fatally it seems, by the Green Goblin. Thing is, he survives... So why bother scaring us? The moment doesn't serve a purpose, other than to provide a sudden, stupid shock for the poor audience. Ultimately, each of the villains fade away, back to their own universes. It's totally anti-climactic, not to mention there's no rematch or even a solid dialogue exchange between the Green Goblin and Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Malpractice from a storytelling standpoint; odd, considering that on the other hand you have a terrific scene where Andrew's Spider-Man catches MJ from falling to her death, as he failed to do so with Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014)... Does narrative closure not apply to all facets of these films? Or did the writers just get forgetful for Tobey? Either way, the ending leaves much to be desired and leaves you wondering: what was the point?Individually, scenes work well. But this isn't a clip show. It's a film. To conclude, No Way Home is a mess. One which nearly totally collapses prior to Andrew and Tobey's appearance. Their scenes are fantastic, and all criticisms aside for one minute, I am grateful I got to see 'em on the big screen one last time. I love it when they bond over shared losses, and Andrew and Tobey's little exchange in the lab... No Way Home is an occasional treat, however nonsensical and pointless on the whole.\", 'Following constant disappointment with Marvel movies, I had come to stop caring for or even watching any. But Spider-man has had a special place in my heart since a kid so I had to watch, especially after hearing rumours. To tell the truth, this exceeded my expectations with great power.With surprisingly good acting and great emotionally loaded scenes, No Way Home managed to capture something many Marvel movies fail. Emotions. This was not only an action-packed movie but also a story-driven movie with fantastic execution. Tom Holland and Zendaya as well as other actors managed to deliver acting never seen in the Marvel universe before.No Way Home captured that heart of the first couple of Spider-man trilogy which I think old fans will admire. Nevertheless, I believe this movie was fantastically done and little mistakes.No Way Home is a great movie I highly recommend.

Going in not knowing what was going to happen made the movie so much better. Seeing Andrew Garfield, Tobey Maguire & Tom Holland all together really is a fans dream and Marvel are giving so much fan service in all their movies lately it really is staggering.I feel most of all, the movie does well in giving Andrew Garfield some love as the Spider-Man character as he mostly gets a raw deal these days as his movies weren't as strong as Raimi's or MCU ones. Andrew Garfield was a good Peter Parker & Spider-Man, he just didn't get that film where he could really shine and this movie practically says as much.Managing to get so many villains to reprise their roles must have been a tall order (i was more surprised to see Thomas Hayden Church back than anyone).The story grips you right from the off as it takes place immediately after the second one & some of the twists and turns i found quite shocking (i should have known better about Aunt May but it still took me by surprise).The ending is really beautiful in a nice sort of way, seeing Peter interact with MJ after the fact is a real heartstring puller. It ends with a conclusion to the trilogy whilst leaving the door ajar for more Tom Holland Spider-Man movies (which if there is any justice, there will be).Tom Hardy's cameo at the end sets up Venom (or at the very least, a version of) to join the MCU, which should be a blast. The idea of Tom Hardy & Holland playing off of each other is cinematic gold.All in all, i think this is the strongest MCU Spider-Man movie and may be the ultimate one for massive Spider-Man fans. Sam Raimi could never have imagined 20 years ago whilst making Spider-Man (2002) that his characters would be still portraying themselves all these years later in the biggest cinematic universe and franchise ever, truly remarkable, just like this film.\", 'I watched this with no prior knowledge of the plot. I had heard rumours but not enough, so each cameo was a genuine surprise for me. Even with that element, I was left dejected.Why? Well, first of all it made no sense. It seemed a ridiculously contrived way of bringing back old villains and actors just for the nostalgia and fan nods without any real premise. It makes no sense that the all powerful all knowing Dr Strange would risk the stability of the universe to get a few kids into college. He knows far too much about actions and consequences to fall into that trap.And Peter\\'s ridiculous idea to save the villains he doesn\\'t know, who belong in another universe, and who have done despicable things to his own alter egos, using what...some science stuff that just happens to be in Happy\\'s apartment? We never know quite how he builds these \"cures\", we just get blinded by movie science talk enough to understand that it\\'s \"science\". Just like Peter trapping Dr Strange in the Mirror Dimension by using \"math\". It\\'s like those old 80s movies where a computer whiz taps random things into a computer and it can do amazing things! How? We don\\'t know, just shut up and eat your popcorn!The dialogue fell oddly flat too. I\\'m a Marvel fan and I enjoy the witty banter, one liners and emotional moments but this fell way short for me. The jokes weren\\'t funny. The interplay between characters felt written by a kid trying to emulate Marvel wit. I just didn\\'t feel it. The 3 Peters answering to Ned calling their name was just rubbish. It simply wasn\\'t funny.And the sentimentality felt forced and false. They all cried so many times. Soaring music over the top. Tears and hugs and therapy. It descended into pathetic, and I didn\\'t want to see good characters being pathetic. I get the angst and pain in previous movies but this was pointless and Peter literally destroyed everything including his last remaining family member over nothing. At least the other Peters\\' regrets were real. This was borne out of pure nonsensical decision making. He wanted to kill The Green Goblin. Why? He was only there because of Peter making ridiculous choices and Aunt May only died because she was as stupid and misguided as Peter. He was just doing what villains do given half a chance - a chance Peter gave him for no logical reason.The fact he saved them in the end was irrelevant and actually did a massive disservice to the previous movies. It devalues what those other Peters did and went through. You may as well cure them too by stopping them getting bitten by spiders in the first place if you\\'re going to be that kind hearted and change history.Would those villains really want to go back to their universe a changed person anyway? They were flawed, broken and destroyed everything they loved. Now they get to go back all \"fixed\"...to what? A broken destroyed world they ruined to no doubt face justice for it. Great, thanks Peter! I think their glorious deaths would have been better. Or are the other Spidermen supposed to smooth it all over when they return?And last but not least, the whole \"forget everyone knows who Spider-Man is\" thing is just crazy. As if Dr Strange hasn\\'t learned enough from trying to do it the first time. Why forget Peter Parker completely? Why not just forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man so he keeps his friends etc? So there was Happy at Aunt May\\'s grave not knowing this was her nephew? That makes no sense at all. What happened at the Statue of Liberty then? What did MJ and Ned remember?I came out of the theatre disappointed. It wasn\\'t like MJ said.

Shang-Chi was only ok, the Venom sequel was atrocious, Black Widow was so-so, Eternals was bland for the most part. What makes this one work is the cast, but the story really, when examined is weak. The last movie put the writers in a corner while revealing (a silly idea really) Peter's identity to the world. He goes to Doctor Strange without thinking about what he really wants, and ends up, in typical spider-man fashion, in screwing everything up. So, also in usual Spider-Man style, by trying to fix things up, he totally messes up further. In the end this costs him a lot. While this movie starts out well, the middle is dull and why should Peter care about beings from alternate realities? And by 'fixing' them, did he erase the events of those films, making the spider-men of those realities unnecessary? Peter loses everything due to his listening to Aunt May, who's advice is illogical and gets her killed. Well, I can say this was the best of Holland's trilogy, but it still isn't Spider-Man 2. A few sides: Molina, Garfield and Maguire's returns were the best part of this movie. Those three steal every single scene they're in. Dafoe was good as Norman, but I could have done without Electro and Sandman who added little to the story. While others are falling over themselves gushing over this, I think I may be suffering from Superhero fatigue.\", 'There is so much to unpack here. And I understand that some people may not be into the first 30 minutes or so of the movie, but it is apparent how much almost everyone loves this movie. And as you can tell I am one of them. Now you could dismiss my opinion, since I have clearly bought and swallowed the MCU pill (I openly admit liking and being a fan boy of what has been created there - you can hate me or simply agree with me, all opinions are welcome) ... but I dare anyone who has seen all Spider Man movies, not to feel at least something rather positive about this.It does take many good things from previous efforts (no pun intended) and gets the best out of them. It does a great service to the (movie) history of Spider-Man. But also showing us a different side of a Marvel hero ... a side that is vulnerable in a way we have not seen yet. Or not in that form - the identity crisis and the good deeds that do not go unpunished ... or do they? Tom Holland has been exposed - something you know if you\\'ve seen the previous Spider-Man movie ... and while his mentor Iron Man dealt differently with that fame - recognition, Peter Parker as we know him, can not deal with it the same way.Add to that, that he wants to help people as much as he can (a bit of a difference to what Tony Stark stood for most of the time, being self centered and and self serving) - and you have a dangerous combination. There is a reason the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies are being compared with 80s teen comedies - there are many parallels (John Hughes and others are being name dropped in those conversations). And while there is a lot of action (the mirror world scene has so many \"climactic\" scenes I probably did not close my mouth the entire time it was happening), the movie also takes its time to give us little character moments.And a lot of fan service - this movie celebrates what came before. It celebrates and takes its audience seriously. But in a fun and entertaining way. Yes it is not all fun and games and there are a lot of callbacks (no pun intended) - there is drama, there may be even some head shaking at how naive Peter Parker seems ... but it makes sense in the realm of the world that was built around him and the character that he is - there is an evolution, but he can\\'t help himself - being who he is and who he grew up to be. For better or worse ... yes the famous line will be uttered and it will have a sad undertone to it. But the movie is able to give you so much, that even when you know something completely horrible is about to happen, you also know that some lighter moments will follow.That being said, it takes nothing away from the performance by Tom Holland, who has to play vulnerable, playful, ecstatic, experimental, shy and giving/helpful ... while a lot has been made of who is going to be in the movie (or not) - it is his movie. Yes there are many things that you can tear apart and make fun of - there are logic issues if you want to call them that ... but in a world where \"magic\" exists ... are you really going to nitpick? Maybe you will, which would be a shame - because you\\'ll be missing out on one hell of a movie and a ride that is truly amazing - no pun intended.It is also amazing that Sony and Disney reached a deal - so that Marvel can continue to use Spiderman in their universe. But not just him ... it seems there is way more to come. And while having many throwbacks (and callbacks) and bringing them all to a conclusion of sorts ... well while all that could mean that this could be a nice way to end Tom Hollands reign as Spider-Man ... it could just as easily continue. The possibilities are endless going forward.As you can tell I am not one to spoil or say anything that is revealing. That is why I did not talk about the cast and the cameos - most of them were revealed ahead of time. Either officially (villains) or just through rumors (no matter how much denying went on - we knew ... we just knew) ... but there was a cameo that most did not see coming - pun very much intended.If you watched this in a cinema (which I can only highly recommend to do), you will probably still have goosebumps. You either cheered yourself loudly at quite a few moments (or gasped at others) ... or just enjoyed silently ... what a movie experience that was. One that I might repeat in cinemas - a treat I do not give myself too often, because I tend to let a bit of time pass before I rewatch something after the first time viewing ... but there are exceptions and this might very well be one of them ... Spider-Man you Sir ... are one of the good ones! Pun again intended - because you too are amazing ...', \"They did it! A Spider-Man trilogy finally stuck the landing!

For me the star of the film was William Defoe he changed his whole face as the Green Goblin took over him. Love the interaction with the villains.Please stay for the mid and end credit scene .', \"Where to begin? I would find it extremely difficult for any Spider-Man fan to dislike this film. What's amazing is the feat that Jon Watts, Kevin Feige, Amy Pascal and others accomplished here.Let me just say the the plot has a lot of mumbo jumbo, comic-book logic that typically most comic fans can get on board with including myself, but because the MCU has built enough trust with everyone, you just kinda go with it. Even if you don't, the magic of all these actors and legacy characters returning for this dazzling spectacle will kinda make you forgive it.Lets also just get this out of the way. It was the worst kept secret that Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield were appearing alongside Tom Holland. The consensus on this was pretty much acknowledged to almost every fanboy, fangirl and most casual fans too. Also the return of Willem Dafoe's Green Goblin, Alfred Molina's Doctor Octopus, Jamie Foxx's Electro, Thomas Haden Church's Sandman and Rhys Ifans' Lizard made it more apparent. It's just a marvel(pun intended) that Sony and Marvel/Disney were able to bring everyone back. Never would I have thought it was possible.The villains are a lot more poignant and prominent than I thought they would be. Alfred Molina and Willem Dafoe are THE MVPs of the bunch. Dafoe is used to great effect and is as menacing as I remember him and Molina commands the screen with his presence and delivery. They still feel very much in tune with what Sam Raimi did. Jamie Foxx has a second chance with Electro and it works a lot more now than it did since the last time we saw him in 2014. Unfortunately Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans are the benchwarmers of the villains. BUT, used to some capacity where they don't feel totally left out.Now lets talk about the Spider-Men.TOM HOLLAND: I think Marvel Studios and Sony either had this planned all along or they heard the fans and listened. What I loved about Holland/MCU's iteration is that he is kid who brings his exciting energy and youthful enthusiasm to the Avengers. Also as fan of Spidey comics, particularly the Ultimate Spider-Man series, I feel most of the best stories is when he's a teenager in high school. So I got what I wanted in that regard, however my criticism of his portrayal is that he was basically Iron Man Jr. With a lot of Stark tech. But here, they strip him down, beat him to a pulp, he loses his Aunt May, makes sacrifices and learns from his mistakes. He finally learns and understands with the help of Tobey and Andrew providing their wisdom. I think finally we are going to get the Spider-Man that we hoped he would grow into. It is Holland's best performance as the character by far.ANDREW GARFIELD: Jon Watts and his writers Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers redeem him. Not that his portrayal was bad, because personally I always found Garfield's Spider-Man the most accurate of the bunch and there are some things to like about the Marc Webb films. Garfield gets the closure he needed as his movies ended abruptly after the 2014 sequel. Every moment he has where he shares his experience with Holland and Maguire on screen is a major highlight. Especially when he talks about Gwen Stacy. He also has a nice moment where he saves Zendaya's MJ, mirroring the fact that he never got to save Gwen. Garfield absolutely crushed it and displayed his amazing acting chops.TOBEY MAGUIRE: For many, including myself Tobey Maguire is the OG. Growing up with his Spider-Man films, words can't really describe the emotions I felt seeing him back. I was practically reliving my childhood the minute he appeared. It was all coming back to me, being on the hype train during his era of films and just obsessing over the Sam Raimi films, it just brought me back. I truly felt like a kid again. Tobey's presence in the film feels very much like the older brother of the group and he bounces off Holland and Garfield seamlessly. It's been a hot minute seeing Tobey on the big screen since PAWN SACRIFICE(good movie by the way) and he hasn't lost a step.Once Garfield and Maguire appear, all three share the limelight as co-leads and not a single one of them feel left out.As for the rest of the cast. Benedict Cumberbatch always commands your attention. I was initially turned off of the idea of having Holland's Spidey have another mentor like figure, but here Strange and Spidey are at odds on how to handle their problem after the botched spell. So that was a nice surprise in the marketing and in the film. Marisa Tomei has way more to do in this film than the previous films and has an emotional send off with her death. Zendaya's MJ has grown on me since FAR FROM HOME and Jacob Batalon's Ned is less annoying here which I appreciated.Piggy backing off that, I did admire that Watts aimed for a more mature tone throughout the film. As I get older I do crave that serious tone a bit more and I savor it every time it is present. I mean yes the standard formulaic humor is still present, but I appreciated every moment where things got serious.I love the MCU and I'm always there to watch their product, but I can be honest and say that at times, they are like comfort food. I know what I'm getting and I know I'll enjoy it. I also haven't been shy of the films I've really disliked, but they have been consistent as a whole. However, when they either take big swings or assemble(pun intended) a film with a more mature tone, every so often we'll get absolute gems like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA trilogy, the first AVENGERS, the first GUARDIANS, and INFINITY WAR. I'm extremely pleased that SPIDER-MAN: NO WAY HOME belongs with those gems. Should Sony and Marvel/Disney keep working together I look forward to more adventures as the Spider-Man I wanted Tom Holland to be. I would also be lying to you if I didn't crave more of Garfield and Maguire. Anything is possible nowadays as we even got a Charlie Cox's Daredevil cameo, which was also heavily speculated and if you've been keeping up with HAWKEYE, you know we're in for a treat.While the story can be cluttered, the film drives it home with the development of Holland's Spider-Man, some excellent performances, and fan service with a purpose. Definitely the best MCU Spider-Man film, one of my favorite MCU entries as a whole, and in the conversation of one of the best Spidey films with Raimi's SPIDER-MAN 2 and INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE.9.5/10.\", \"This film has a strong story and emotional core I haven't seen too often in marvel.

One of Spider-Man\\'s best traits is his quick thinking and it was so inevitable that after messing up the spell, he decides to go and talk to the headteacher of the college for a placement(same scene where Doctor Octopus appears).

It could have been avoided if he had just sent them home, but no they needed to be \"cured\"(which is odd because The Lizard was cured in the Amazing Spider-Man). It just made him look sappy and too Disney like, thinking he can change their fate. It\\'s also not smart to invite dangerous villains into your house with a non superhero family member there. How could he trust them that quickly? When you see it, you find it hard to feel bad for Peter because you\\'re like \"yeah this guy sucks\" The emotional scenes in this movie were pretty awful, especially how long and stretched May\\'s death was and they still tried to exchange jokes and had her standing up right before dying(also re wording Uncle Ben\\'s infamous line which sounded wrong). Family member deaths are always before the character becomes a hero so doing it after feels cheap. It wasn\\'t even basic superhero bad luck, just Spider-Man not thinking straight.Marvel really need new writers(especially in the comedic department), because they\\'ve released 4 bad movies this year and a TV show that messed up a timeline just like No Way Home did. And they\\'ve also ruined Spider-Man\\'s character by not properly developing him and just throwing him into the Avengers drama. They are cash grabbers and only adding him because he is popular and it will get the movie ticket sales up. No Way Home is one of the few movies that make me wish the villains had won, and the reason is that the plot armour on Spider-Man was too strong. Like when geometry was somehow the answer to get out of the mirror dimension. Green Goblin was right about his morality getting the better of him.Overall this movie was just an overhyped, over budgeted nostalgia bait and Spider-Man is the real antagonist of this film. Always puts people in danger for no reason.', \"Spiderman Far From Home is to years of stand alone Spider-Man movies what Avenger Endgame was to Avengers: an amazing grand finale to wrap up all the previous adventures in a grand manner, thus allowing a new phase.This allows something very special:\\nTobey, Andrew & Tom are no longer three different set of movies, they all come to as one adventure, together.Spidey is now reset to a new beginning (no caretaker, no girlfriend, no best friend). This will allow the building of a whole new story.Because Spidey Tom still remembers it all, this closed chapter can't be dismissed or forgotten, it is the building block of what's to come. It's a bittersweet legacy which opens door to bringing back the past if writers want to go that way at a later stage (after all, a spell can be reversed, most times!).I always loved these three actors, seeing them together was a dream come true I could never have dreamt of in the past. And before you know it, it's already the end of the movie, this is how captivating it is. 10/10 for me for sure!\", \"This is it! What a masterpiece watching I remember watching the first Spider-Man at age 7 in cinemas excited not knowing what to expect and was blown away! Here we are almost 20 years later I've never felt so complete watching a film! What a PAYOFF!\", \"While I have several Marvel and DC superhero movies that I like, I also have many that I do not like, and I'm not that easily impressed. For example, I honestly found the previous Spiderman movie to be mostly pretty boring. But this one...this is amazing! The way both of the previous Spidermen, as well as pretty much all the major villains, from the old movies, all feature in this (they don't just make cameos, they are actively part of the story!), and are ALL played by the original actors, is just so incredibly awesome! They even throw in Daredevil and Venom cameos! Then add on the fact that they actually try to SAVE all the villains rather than kill them...It's just fantastic...If you're a Spiderman fan, or a superhero fan, this is a mut-watch, and if you're not, you should see it anyway!\", 'This movie had everything I ever wanted and then some.

As a big Spider-Man fan I got a surprising few things from this movie too. First of all they stuck with the villains stories no matter the reception they got on the previous films they stuck with it and that\\'s honestly so respectful. To see not all of them actually be villains because Peter is trying to help them from themselves by not dying was the Spider-Man I have been hoping to see from Tom Holland which I didn\\'t feel in the other movies. Green Goblin is easily the most terrifying how he pretends to be on Peters side and tries to manipulate Peter and May. Lizard wasn\\'t in it much but hey he was still good in the movie. Sandman was awesome, he protected Peter from Electro after the events of Spider-Man 3 and just wanted to be with his daughter. Electro was fun and fresh too with his new look and the visuals. Doc Ock obviously amazing and to hear the call backs to Spider-Man 2, so happy they didn\\'t make him a villain and he actually helped them. Second of all Aunt May being Peters \"Uncle Ben\" was amazing, she delivered the line perfectly and she was just great especially since we had more screen time with her in these movies than we did with Ben in the others. Thirdly Matt Murdock! Are you kidding me! A very small part but wow it\\'s good to see him again looking great and I can\\'t wait to see what they do with that character. Fourthly Andrew and Tobey of course... Andrew coming through that portal and being not quite sure if it was him until he came forward was unreal everyone went mad in the cinema (Same with Tobey) he is still great after years, Tobey amazing too they just hold a special place in a lot of peoples hearts and their interactions with the characters especially Peter (Toms) Just very impactful and maybe they will come back who knows. 5th point is that in the portal coming through we saw Kraven and a Rhino variant and I wanted them to come but who knows... overall they ended the film great with the villains not having to die. Final points I\\'ll say is that Green Goblin vs Peter was pretty brutal, it was intense and Tobey stopping Peter from killing him was just so perfect. My last final point is that ending... Peter having to leave everything behind to keep them safe was the Spider-Man we all know and love. Him getting an apartment struggling to get by and being Spider-Man still with a comic accurate suit and not an iron spider suit. This is the Spider-Man I have wanted and I can\\'t wait to see what they will do. The ending made me think of the game for the PS4/5 and if they go down that route of tone and stuff then this could be some of the best Spider-Man movies coming up. No gadgets, just Spider-Man and Peter Parker being their natural selves and the heroes we all love. Overall this film is something else and I\\'m glad I was there to see it, it\\'s a good laugh, it\\'s a good thrill and it\\'s Spider-Man. Thank you to everyone who made this film!', 'Faith in their ability to write good stories has been briefly restored!!

I will make it simple, the movie will live to your expectations If not exceed them, however, during the first half of the film you won't witness anything new. Every fight scene is in the trailer and I LITREALLY mean every fight scene. But don't get me wrong they were awesome and of course not the whole fight scenes. It's also full of talking and a bit more funny lines than usual. You also have a very very silly plot that was based on some character's opinion and lead to all the events of the film and then comes on of the best plots and entrances near the beginning of the second half that you will ever witness and here comes the second half of the movie and trust me it was beyond awesome. The VFX of this film is breathtaking. Every action sequence is very complicated and loaded with tons of details. The visuals are insaaane. You also have a couple of Spidy suits and most importantly you won't be disappointed with anything you might be expecting. You have Dr. Strange and believe me it was one of the best times you will see him along with another hero cause Benedict is such a great actor. Zendaya role however was meaningless but you know she is Spidy's GF. The Finale of the film is beyond great and feels like a dream come true for all fans around the world that will leave you full of emotions, amazed and shocked! Even the two post credit scenes made everyone yell in the theatre (who yelled for more than half of the movie). Not a perfect movie and a lot of things may not make sense and will make your brain full of questions like Endgame and that's what make a movie a great one. I have now experienced the whole trilogy at the theatre and there is no doubt that this one is the best.

Well obviously that goes wrong and a dimension portal opens to different worlds where villains dont recognize the present casted Peter Parker. Seems clever on paper but it is a slog. The only gimmick is that we see Peter Parkers from previous flicks. What you get are momentum killing conversations between the Spideys. Which, for fans, suppose it's great to shoehorn legacy. For people who are too young to know anyone of the previous ones. Im sure theyll be confused.This entire movie moves at a snails pace and suffers from bloat. You can slash a half hour and still be fine. This culminates in the death of Aunt May. Because, if you follow the storylines Spidermans have to have a loved one die at their own stupid decisions.

Here, Parker's Spider-Man finally gets to grown in me, being faithful to the source and ending his evolution within Avengers universe on a riprousingly high.

But if your food is a bit too sour, bitter and sweet and it's not balanced out you wouldn't like the whole experience. This was such a lame excuse to introduce the Multiverse and make way for other movies. This wasn't well tailored for me.\", \"This movie is great. It really is great. This movie have a lot of villians but that doesn't hurt it not at all. I must say by far the best MCU spider-man film to date. They handle the question of revenge so great I think. The ending is just yeah phenomenal. I don't even know what to say barely left the theater before I started to write this both Tobey and Andrew back. (sorry Nicholas Hammond maybe next time). If you love any of the 2 previous versions you will most likely love this movie since there are a bunch of references and actors from those are returning back. Peter Parker also have good character growth at the end of the movie he doesn't feel like a kid anymore. He feel a lot mroe mature and finally is standing on his own legs. It is great watch it if you haven't. Honestly you shouldn't even read this if you haven't watched it.\", 'I had no idea what to expect from this movie. The couple reviews I heard had only mentioned that No Way Home was \"surprising\". I was ready to be disappointed to say the least. However I quite enjoyed it. For awhile many people have wondered how the individual spider man movies fit into the same narrative and how they conceptualized it was impressive. Not to mention the fact that they were able to get the original actors from the other spider man movies.. Absolutely loved the banter between the spider men and the loyalty they had for their own story within their respective universe. I also liked the set up for continuation with another Doctor Strange movie. I hope we can see more of him in the future.', \"I love this movie. I never thought I would see three Spiderman going against one of the OG villains from the previous Spider-Man. This film was fun and surprising and I'm glad to see this in opening night. The only flaw I had is that I wish we had a little more storytelling to it but the Aunt May Death was very emotional and it did feel a little rush to me.

That were brought together in the same universe after Dr. Strange erroneously cast a dangerous spell.(We needed an excuse for this to happen, of course)\\nMy personal review here:\\nI\\'ll be honest, I never was much of a fan of Holland\\'s Spider-Man. The reason I went to see this film was because my inner child needed to see with his own eyes, the possibility of Tobey and Andrew coming back.And, yes. I cried like a baby the moment I watched the Spider-Man from my childhood meeting the Spider-Man from my adolescence.This was VERY beautiful to watch.For a second I even sobbed.But then... something was left.It felt as if the writers did not know what to do with the three \"Spider-Men\" after putting them all together.After that huge moment, that made us all scream and clap, it didn\\'t take long till the dialogue started to feel dumb, with fan service jokes or even about their own movies as Spider-Man.Like, \"yeah, you are the second one\".The moment I saw Tobey, Andrew and Tom together, I thought:\\n\"Oh my god, this is going to be epic af\"\\n\"This will probably be the most important film of our generation\".But, by the end of the third act, I realized:\\nThey did it again...\\nThey took the characters we\\'ve loved since we were kids to put them in a millionaire project with a really bad script.Repeating Raimi\\'s mistake. They put so many villains that they didn\\'t know what to do with them, not even with three Spider-Man\\'s.The movie started to feel rushed after that. Causing plot holes, lack of emotions or a good dialogue between each Spider-Man and the enemy from his own universe.(Tobey Maguire sees Norman Osborn ALIVE again and he doesn\\'t say a word to him?)\\n(Tobey Maguire sees Otto Octavius ALIVE again and they only exchange two words as if they had seen each other at Home Depot)\\nThey gave us a cheapie 20 minute fight where they must \"cure\" every single villain with a magical injection? With barely any good or lasting scenes from each Spider-Man.Not to mention the horrific way Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield just \"vanished\", going back to their respective universes.The movie only lasts two hours and a half. Would it have been so difficult to add 30 more minutes of the three Spider-Man\\'s in action?We barely saw Maguire or Garfield fighting or do anything else before that terrible goodbye.And by the way, what happened to Tobey Maguire? And I\\'m not talking about his age, I\\'m talking about how unexpressive and autistic he looks and talks in this movie.Was that scripted?My final words in this review:\\nSeeing the old Spider-Man\\'s on the big screen again was something too beautiful, but it wasn\\'t \"epic\".But it could have been.It could\\'ve been the most glorious movie we ever saw in our lives...\\nBut, the film industry does not focus on good stories nowadays.', 'I think this is one of the best movies ever loved everything about it.

Out of all the Spider-Man movies I have seen (The original Raimi trilogy and the MCU trilogy), this one is the best. And that's saying a lot, because Spider-Man 2 was an absolute masterpiece that made me really appreciate not just Spider-Man, but Peter Parker, the boy behind the mask who wants so desperately to live two separate lives, one as a superhero with the responsibility to save the lives of the people around him, and another as just a regular, gold-hearted kid with friends and family. All that being said, however, the reason I like No Way Home more than Spider-Man 2 is because I had not actually seen the Raimi trilogy until AFTER I saw No Way Home, as that movie is what made me realize how deep Spider-Man actually is and that I wanted to look more into him. So, me loving this movie the most is almost definitely because of my personal experience with it. It sparked my interest in the webbed hero with just a kid behind the mask, and it did so while also living up to the expectations of long-time veterans and fans of him. This movie is an absolute must see if you are at all interested in Spider-Man. While it may not be perfect and have its flaws (like the pacing at some points being a bit weird and having quite a slow, drawn-out startup), it is still an absolute masterpiece in the Marvel series, and the writers, directors, and all others involved in the making of this film can be happy knowing that Stan Lee is smiling down upon them from heaven, truly proud of how his beautiful character and universe is being carried on to soar high.\", 'I loved this movie!

But in this film i was more entertained of how mature he is now after fricking six films. It was good that aunt may died so he can go through grief and finally redeem himself. After the film I was hyped to see Peters next chapter.There's a few scenes that bugs me out and that's of course the jokes and a few didn't land and the writing seemed bad sometimes during the movie, but that's just a nitpick.The amazing part of the movie was that we did explore the so called multi verse and in someday many characters will clash together from other universes, we did see that in this film and oooooooooo boy I was screaming like a baby. Too see the three generations of spider men clashing together to stop the villains was just breathtaking to see. I loved every second of it and just to see Andrew and Tobey back was emotional.

For the most part, though, it worked even if more could have been done with such an ambitious concept. The success comes mainly from what I have to say below.Just about every factor that went into making this film was done with the utmost care. Even though I mentioned a few plot device inconsistencies above, the character focus in this movie is strong and fully realized to further expand chemistries in our main cast. The emotional appeal is stronger than ever and we really feel the power with outstanding performances and antagonist thrills.Not only does this movie combine universes' characters, it also blends together themes presented from those universes for a whole heartedly meaningful purpose beyond fan fare. That is truly the most impressive accomplishment in my opinion. An intellectual achievement. It also did very well with combining humor with the more serious moments.Michael Giacchino outdid himself this time around with a musical score that shows an understanding of the scenes' emotions and intensity. Too often do action movies switch too quickly between slow and fast-paced, but here we have good transitions and unexpected power during the crucial moments. Additionally, the action scenes themselves were smoothly filmed and accompanied by awesome visuals at times.Overall, a great film in this universe that opens the door to complex possibilities. The strong character focus sells this film with refreshingly new ways of defeating antagonists and a third act that plunges into powerful and even heartbreaking moments. It was all subtle enough to work without being over the top, and even though more could have been done, this is a movie I will not soon forget.

Not just because it is bad, but because of the misuse of all the resources that went into making it.I will be the first to admit that I have propensity to look for meaning when I am watching a film. Be it the straight-forward moral of the story or a higher meaning, something to make you think. That is how I enjoy cinema the most, when it gives me something to think about. Big or small. When the images on the screen are about something more than simply the images on the screen.This film is the complete opposite of it. Its meaning is inward-looking. It is not interested of looking at anything other than itself. It is complete and utter navel-gazing. That really is the crux of the film. That is the reason why this is barely watchable. Every flaw and mistake comes from this movie\\'s own excessive self-contemplation.Where to put the blame is a different question. It has been established for some time that these MCU films are not \"directed\". There is no singular vision behind them and it boils down to an assembly line. The plot and dialogue are so bad I can\\'t imagine anyone put any amount of thought into it. All the lines do actually feel like ad-libs the actors improvised on the day. Visually there is an absence of flair (and I am being generous) which is on par for the course for these movies by now. The soundtrack and sound design is, of course, forgettable. The editing is conventional. The set design is reminiscent of those real-estate videos where celebrities show their homes. The costume design is ok, again which is not shocking knowing the means that were allocated to this.The acting could have been the saving grace of the movie. Unfortunately, Tom Holland, Zendaya and Jacob Batalon are the stars of the film. And while their performances are good, they usually have to share the screen with (multiple) Oscar-winners. It is jarring to see the best talent doing what is basically glorified background work. That is why this is the worst movie of all time. You have a film packed with the best actors working today, but we have to follow Tom Holland\\'s inane struggle on how to apply to some college.I am not even sure I want to go into the plot. In truth it does not matter. I suspect that even the makers of this took that as a given. The Marvel Cinematic Universe has now morphed into a never ending reference and call-backs machine. That is the core of this film: \"remember this?!\" The structure of it is one of a TV show, except in TV there is an A-plot and a B-plot. This film is all B-plot.As I am writing this, this film has been viewed by millions and is one of the highest grossing movies of all time.

It has Raimi written all over it, and even at its worst moments, the least you could dub it is memorable. The follow-up series doesn\\'t have that same appeal, but Garfield\\'s charisma shines through, as it similarly does here. Conversely, Holland\\'s rendition has always felt a little cut-and-paste from its surrounding universe, unable to separate itself from the whimsy and bathos of the MCU. This Peter Parker\\'s one-liners are drawn from the same snarky persona as Iron Man, Star-Lord, War Machine, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man...the list goes on. I\\'ve made my peace with it. It isn\\'t a new criticism, and could be levelled at most films post-Phase One. But it\\'s always felt limiting in terms of crafting distinct character (and filmic) voices and undermining attempts at sentimentality. Let\\'s start with Cumberbatch\\'s Strange. He\\'s stepping into the mentor role post-Endgame but he\\'s never been given a meaningful opportunity to develop his own philosophy on the character, let alone a voice. Sans his solo film, the premise of the Sorcerer Supreme makes him a convenient plot device to facilitate the adventures of other superheroes. Listen to his dialogue here; it\\'s always delivered at a distance, drenched in cynicism, as if it\\'s afraid of fully buying into the idea of a connection. Cumberbatch seems to be constantly setting up the next punchline, and so even if this abrasive back-and-forth elicits laughs, it never builds to anything genuine, rendering the climatic callback (obvious from a mile away) into a deflated attempt at growth and recognition. Yes, RDJ addressed Holland in the same way, but there was history and a relationship there. There\\'s an inherent self-consciousness to the way that Feige and co. Craft the MCU\\'s humour, so relentlessly wary of losing the audience for more than a second that they keep sincerity at an arm\\'s length. Observe how the entire film just grinds to a halt for the Spidey\\'s stand-up routine atop the Statue of Liberty scaffolding; the trialogue isn\\'t written for the characters, it\\'s written for the fans to play spot the reference (\"You\\'re amazing. I want to hear you say it.\"). Marvel would never in a million years allow their Spider-Man to be the butt of the joke, or freeze-frame on his goofy smile over \\'Raindrops Keep Fallin\\' on My Head\\'. He\\'s too cool for that.This universe\\'s Peter Parker and his defining Spider-Man moment is how he reacts to losing his Uncle Ben, but the crux of its emotional impact rests on what has already been established. What do we really know about this version of Aunt May, anyway? No, not what we surmise and assume based on the previous actions of the mentor archetype, but her as an actual person. How much screentime has Tomei been afforded here and in the first two films that isn\\'t delegated to punchlines about her hotness or her apparent fling with Happy? You need to earn the right to drop that iconic line about responsibility; the words don\\'t hold any weight in and of themselves. What does follow her death works in pushing Peter into newer and darker territory for this Spider-Man, and Holland is finally asked to consider the interiority of his character and how these circumstances might actually damage the psyche of a teenager. After all, what was the complication of Far From Home beyond mopping up the external mess of an Avengers-level threat? Here, Peter must contend with the consequences of his actions (the film initially made me balk at the idea of resetting the universe just so a few teens could get accepted into their college of choice, and then cleverly flips that on its head) and ultimately assume the burden and emotional baggage that comes with being a superhero. The rooftop scene where Maguire and Garfield confess of their own failures and futile quests for vengeance is unlike anything even the MCU is capable of; it\\'s not merely a crossover, but a character speaking across generations to itself, pleading for this Peter to avoid repeating their past mistakes. It leans pretty hard on the audience having that pre-knowledge; you need to know the stories they refer to in order to buy into the emotion, but for those who do, it\\'s genuinely affecting.So Peter completes his mission and manages to do justice to Aunt May\\'s final wish, but what of the \\'villains\\'? The other core theme of the film, beyond Peter\\'s grappling with his grief and the value of revenge, is the idea of second chances being afforded to those who deserve them (who, in Aunt May\\'s world, is everyone). Yet how much of this actually rings true for each member of the Spidey rogues gallery dragged in from the multiverse? Norman and Otto are afforded the most agency as a result of their characters\\' redemption being more or less pre-ordained. They don\\'t need \\'fixing\\', just a removal of that corruptive influence and a reversion to their original selves. But what of the others? Electro is stripped of his powers and therefore his bloodlust, makes a brief quip referencing Miles Morales, and then is returned to live life as his pre-superpowered, nerdy outcast self. What lesson does he learn? Sandman, as one of the relatively more sympathetic villains of the Spideyverse, was already redeemed at the end of his chapter and never even died at the hands of Spider-Man, so his appearance here is puzzling, reduced once more to an angry CGI spectacle that hits things (Thomas Haden Church receives all of 20 seconds of screentime, with the rest of his stay in sand form). Peter may take responsibility for mistakes made and change himself for good, but how much of this change transfers over to those he impacted? It\\'s a little too neat of a thematic bow to tie all these different arcs together in the name of redemption. The action itself is fine, inoffensive; the climactic battle starts off poorly for the Spideys, before Holland gives a pep talk about teamwork and they then execute a series of pre-planned, carefully choreographed moves in front of a blue screen, only this time it works! There\\'s nothing actually revealed about leadership or teamwork here, but we don\\'t care; we just want that master shot of their superhero landings. It\\'s screensaver material.Legacy is key here: that of this live-action universe across three generations of the webslinger, of the characters within their worlds, and of the films themselves. It\\'s now nigh impossible to engage with this franchise without consuming each and every chapter of its storytelling, an increasingly mammoth task that grows with each phase, miniseries, and cinematic event. You can\\'t just view them as one-offs; you need to buy in and subscribe and devote time to tracking and keeping tabs on its chronology. Your reward is the payoff for this dedication; you know that character, you know the event that they are referencing when it comes up on the big screen. Garfield\\'s Peter is forced to relive the same moment that led to Gwen\\'s death during his rescue of MJ, and fans can recognise the trauma it induces and how significant and moving it is for him to be able to save her this time round. Other fans, however, from the looks of internet reaction videos, seem to be cheering in recognition of this. Is that not emblematic of the two camps of MCU takes in conflict with each other? I\\'m unsure whether they can or should be conflated. In 2012, when the MCU was still in its infancy, Ebert wrote this of The Avengers: \"It provides its fans with exactly what they desire. Whether it is exactly what they deserve is arguable.\" I think we do deserve these films. We\\'ve supported the franchise from its early rocky beginnings, and we\\'ve been there every step of the way in its evolution into a cultural giant. I experienced my own payoff, as millions around the world did, seeing Avengers Endgame almost a decade later as each character stepped out of their portals, the goosebumps on my arm as close to something quantifiable for that feeling of awe and yes, recognition. What lies in future for this franchise, and what is (if there are any plans for, commercial or otherwise) its endgame? I didn\\'t feel anything of that calibre watching No Way Home, but I think it still sticks its landing. Having sacrificed his own relationships to fix the mess that emerged from his faults, Holland returns to where I think Peter Parker truly belongs: in a run-down apartment, landlord berating him for the rent, once again alone with only his suit for company. But there\\'s a reason why the most important scenes are always shot with the mask off. This is where the core and heart of the character resides, and what Spider-Man 2 and Spider-Verse understood so well: the power was never a choice, but accepting the responsibility that comes with it is. Holland\\'s Peter finally makes that choice, and in doing so unveils the human behind the mythos of the superhero. No nanotech or Instant-Kill Mode could ever make up for that.', 'How do people keep watching the same movie over and over again and not get bored? I don\\'t understand how people can watch this and say \"yeah this was a slightly different story than that other one (because why even name them differently) and I like that\"Like are you all just so empty inside with your regular life that you\\'re defense mechanism is go watch the same movie for like a self soothing?

After Mysterio reveals Peter Parker's(Tom Holland) true identity, Peter's world is turned upside down. Peter goes to Doctor Strange(Benedict Cumberbatch), to make the world forget he's Spider-Man. However, the spell goes awry & villains from the multiverse show up. Now, Peter will find out what it truly means to be Spider-Man.Spider-Man: No Way Home is an awe-inspiring film. Director Jon Watts has perfectly completed his Spider-Man trilogy. The action set pieces are jaw-dropping. The visual effects are fantastic. The 3D is eye-popping, especially in IMAX. The humor & the emotional scenes are on point, just like every other Spidey movie. You will cry, laugh and cheer till your voice gets hoarse. Tom Holland is spectacular as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Tom Holland further solidifies that his portrayal of the iconic superhero, is the best. Zendaya is outstanding as MJ. Holland & Zendaya share electrifying chemistry, in all their scenes together. Jacob Batalon is superb as Ned Leeds. Jamie Foxx is brilliant as Max Dillon/Electro. Willem Dafoe is phenomenal as Norman Osborn/Green Goblin. Dafoe proves yet again, why he's the best Spider-Man villain in the entire franchise. Alfred Molina is excellent as Otto Octavius/Doctor Octopus. Thomas Haden Church is great as Flint Marko/Sandman. Rhys Ifans is impressive as Dr. Curt Connors/The Lizard. The supporting cast is unforgettable. Spider-Man: No Way Home is a must watch for die-hard and casual Spider-Man fans. Go & web up a whale of a time!\", '\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is the third solo Spider-Man movie to be set in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Starring Tom Holland once again in the lead role, it goes without saying that this is the best live action Spider-Man film ever made and probably ever will be made for that matter.In the events after \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\", the secret identity of Peter Parker (Tom Holland) as Spider-Man has been exposed to the entire world after his fight with Quentin Beck/Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal). No longer being able to take the onslaught of media and public backlash, Peter seeks help from Doctor Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to cast a spell to make everyone forget he is Spider-Man. However, during the casting of the spell, Peter accidentally causes things to go wrong, fracturing the multiverse and leading to the emergence of many villains from realities unfamiliar to this one.Aside from Batman, the superhero that has left the most impact on me personally is Spider-Man. In fact, the very first superhero film I ever saw at the cinema was the 2002 Sam Raimi-directed \"Spider-Man\" starring Tobey Maguire. I\\'d probably go as far to say it is that film I credit with helping to kick-start my fondness for the genre as a whole, paving the way for many others like it. With \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" acknowledging not only the original Raimi films but the Marc Webb-directed, Andrew Garfield-led \"Amazing Spider-Man\" films as well, there was bound to be a lot of speculation surrounding whether or not it could live up to all this hype. In short, the answer is a resounding yes.Not since \"Avengers: Endgame\" has a Marvel superhero film affected me on such an emotional level and not since the 2008 \"Iron Man\" film has a solo hero story left this much of an impact. Of course, to discuss my favourite parts would give away vital spoilers so I won\\'t go into too much detail here. I absolutely love the amount of respect paid to each of these series of films. Even the divisive \"Amazing Spider-Man\" films, which I actually liked despite their flaws, are treated with just as much love and affection as their Raimi/MCU counterparts. Moments like these go beyond simple fanservice and are clearly there as a thank you to everyone who have stuck with this iconic hero for almost twenty years now. They certainly put a big smile on the face of this responsible 30-something adult.The concept of the multiverse was first teased back in \"Avengers: Endgame\" and further elaborated on in the Disney+ series \"Loki\". However, for the most part, those ventures had a proper sense of management preventing things from spiralling out of control. Here, everything feels like fair game. The stakes are at an all time high as these villains pour out from their respective universes to seek vengeance on their particular Peter Parker, not knowing that they won\\'t find him here at all. Anyone who knows me will remember that I love stories that involve alternate realities and history, so to see something like this combined with a film about one of my favourite superheroes was nothing short of wonderful. This film keeps you on your toes as you anticipate who Spider-Man will fight next. Again, I won\\'t reveal which of the villain fights excited me the most due to spoilers so all I will say is that each of them had at least one moment that made the young kid inside me very happy.Tom Holland has come a long way since we first saw him don the Spider-Man suit back in \"Captain America: Civil War\". His high-spirited youthfulness has not waned over the past five years since he still has that uncanny ability to entertain us with his unique take on the beloved hero. That\\'s not to say he is only capable of light-hearted fun, as here we see him demonstrate some of his darkest acting to date. This film definitely isn\\'t afraid to hit us hard in the feels at the most appropriate times, frequently delving deep into Peter Parker\\'s emotional state at such an important point in his life.Additionally, I have finally come to accept Zendaya\\'s performance as MJ. It has taken me three films but her version of the character has finally grown on me. Originally, I found her pessimistic attitude and willingness to bring the mood down highly annoying but she has now matured into a vital ally of Peter that I enjoy seeing on screen. Naturally, her chemistry with Holland feels genuine, considering the two actors are actually dating in real life with their romantic scenes adding that much needed heart to the film.I won\\'t speak at length about any specific villain as that will give away major spoilers so all I will say is that seeing each of them again in one place was quite overwhelming, but this time in a good way. It\\'s both amusing and surprising to see Raimi-era villains interact with Webb-era villains who are equally as confused as to why they have been transported into this universe. Something that certain Spider-Man films have come under fire for is their cramming of too many villains into one movie, leaving the story cluttered and incomprehensible. This time around, it actually works to the film\\'s advantage since the idea of there being multiple universes following a different timeline has already been properly established. Something like this leaves things open for other multiverse-related oddities happening in future MCU projects, which excites me greatly.Since the film has set the bar so high, I can\\'t help but wonder how the MCU will ever be able to top it. Like \"Avengers: Endgame\" before it, \"No Way Home\" should be treated as something of a watershed moment in the entire MCU. It succeeds in entertaining both longtime fans of the Spider-Man character who have been watching him for nearly twenty years while simultaneously serving the purpose as a great continuation of the ever-expanding MCU storyline. With that said, I think all fans of Spider-Man owe it to themselves to see this film as soon as possible. And yes, I do mean ALL fans.I rate it a solid 9/10.', 'This movie was so epic and rich in story. I kept smiling the entire movie and it was roller coaster ride with my emotions. I just absolutely loved every bit of this film. If you are a marvel fan u are gonna love it!Personally i felt like a kid again.', \"Firstly, I'm a big spidey fan. I've loved all the actors who played them but I do consider Tom Holland the best out of the three.I don't want to post any spoilers how ever obvious they might seem to some, because I know people who still know nothing about this film but I have to say, WHAT A FILM!!I didn't want it to end!

In its favor, however, we must say that is character has been cast aside to make shine other characters, like the great Alfred Molina\\'s Doc Ock.As always, the film is pervaded by a light atmosphere, typical of the Marvel movies, but it is surely deepest movie of the \"Home trilogy\".Good work from Jon Watts, capable of administrate such a big cast and give an honorable finale to Tobey Maguire\\'s Spider-man, while Andrew Garfield\\'s Spider-man seems has something more to say... maybe, we will see!', \"This films triggers a nostalgia trip for many as it revisits past characters from the Mark Webb Spider Man films and Sam Raimi's Spider Man films as well.

Memory is comparable to but distinct from learning in which is the process by which we acquire knowledge of the world. Our learning process and how we become someone we are today in life depends on how we \"manage\" our memory. We can use it to make ourselves better,...or worse.The events in No Way Home are started with Peter Parker tries to erase other people\\'s memory about him. An effort that leads to big consequences & great responsibilities.Villains become villains triggered by their memories. Other Spider-Men become wiser because they\\'ve been learning so much from their memories.In film, Eternal Sunset of the Spotless Minds, Dr. Howard Mierzwaik uses a procedure called\\n\"reconsolidation\" to eliminate or destroy the memory, preventing it from future recall. But what happens next? People loses their identity, their \"emotional core\". What at first is seen as the most logical way to reinvent one\\'s self, losing memory is the cause of bigger catastrophe.The term \"second chance\" in No Way Home means trying to be better persons by embracing memories: mistakes and other things we\\'ve been through in the past. I admire the decision from the screenwriters to assimilate \"second chance\" with memory and how we should not erase the memory, but rather to deal and to manage it for something better. No Way Home also manages to reconcile the DNA of this franchise by continuing the mantra spelled by Sam Raimi, \"With great power, comes great responsibilities\" & uses \"memory\" to cement that.With great power and the ability to manage our memory, we can bear the brunt of great responsibilities.Our memories of people close to us; our memories of people that are meaningful to us, shaping our identity, to become the better version of ourselves.Peter might ask Doctor Strange to eradicate the most painful events in his life in order to move on. But no, he lives with the memories of people he loves the most. To start a new life, embracing his memories to be better.No Way Home underlines what we love about the grounded and friendly neighborhood superhero.It doesn\\'t matter what other people\\'s memory about him; he doesn\\'t need to be remembered as big hero. What really matters to him is the memory of people he loves about him.Ooh what a way to use memory to start the new chapter of another trilogy (I assume) of Spider-Man.', \"After leaving the cinema it dawned on me what I'd just watched a film that should have been lost through inter studio politics and there greedy hands but what we have is quite possible the zenith of all superheroes movies.

Sheer madness!Without spoiling anything, No Way Home opens umpteenth of possibilities for new plots and world-building in that the next Spiderman trilogy or Marvel films, anything and everything can happen or exist beyond a shadow of a doubt.Mystical and mysterious, this most anticipated film of the year provides a plot that is rarely seen in the superhero cinematic landscape. It's exciting, refreshing and breaking new grounds insofar that it's unpredictable as it keeps on searching for new angles to entice both the old and new generations.People may get disconnected with the plot because it involves time and magic. However, what's so great about No Way Home is in the friendly tone and weight that they present to the audience, making it easy to understand even coming from someone who is not a huge fan of superhero films.Tom Holland powerfully brings everything here to the table. His range of acting and emotional skills has improved tremendously since the predecessor. Even for someone who despises him, you'll be knocking yourself off your feet in no time!Compared to other origin films that opts for typical storytelling, No Way Home attempts to balance humor, drama and action all in one movie and oh my, how it succeeds at that is just one huge jaw-dropping spectacle.As revealed in the trailer, there are plenty of villains await and everyone has a screentime just or almost as much as the others. No one is in the spotlight too little or too much, resulting in an appropriate amount of sheer greatness to introduce back all the bad guys.There are a lot of jokes to spot in this film. However, some of them offer subtlety and puns that you can see it coming only by the help of your own experience and intelligence. Only when you see the film, you'll understand what I'm saying.Never have I seen such a beautiful but haunting ending before. I don't wanna say much here but the ending alone is a masterpiece that it feels like it's coming from an Oscar-worthy film and I'm not exaggerating even one bit.The one thing I dislike here with No Way Home is its cheesiness during the first half. It projects this parody-like vibe that somehow takes us out of the experience a little bit. Even I get a tingling sense that the cameras are just too lazy to shoot the movie.The 2 post-credits scenes are good and exciting but I feel like it doesn't live the hype to all the existing theories on the web. Good but nothing shocking.Verdict: Within 150 minutes, Spiderman No Way Home offers a rollercoaster ride of a thousand of emotions, similar to Infinity War & Endgame and it is definitely the best Marvel origin stand-alone film to date.\", 'So for me to really love a movie i have to love everything about it and not just pieces of it. And there was basically no story here. The story of the whole movie is Spiderman asks dr strange to make the world forget him. And the rest of the movie is about the villains that show up basically just joking around having fun and trying to kill Spiderman. Reacting to the story without really adding anything to it.The rest of the movie has a lot of plot holes. A whole Lot. Like for the movie to happen Spiderman has to suddenly think he can cure mental illness. And To suddenly realize that the giant lizard man was left behind in the van. Maybe we was going to go to the 7-11 and bring back a mountain dew. Who know what they were thinking. But this scene and others like it feel so forced and does not happen naturally.The spells and how they backfire make zero sense..but we could debate that all day.I feel like the most wasted opportunity was to not bring Gwen Stacy back from the dead to reunite with Garfield Spiderman. Everyone else was dead .its not a leap to say Gwen could come back too. And of Course No James Franco...a huge wasted opportunity.Overall not the best marvel movie.

This is the love child of the entire MCU. The action is fantastic, everything is great, and there is so many brilliant callbacks and wonderful nostalgia mixed with love, emotions and great acting. For the first 40min or so this is one of the best superhero movies ever made, with Daredevil cameo as the top of the line - and I loved this move, however it has a few errors that lower the score and the longer the movie goes the less I enjoyed it which is kinda strange since the ending is spectacular and Amazing.The CGI is not always on point. Those computer graphic misses stod out was because it is excellent otherwise, so kinda weird with a few misses. I think the Sandman was badly done and The Lizard was a joke. I also seriously dislike Peter decision to try to save everyone and the fight with Strange. That is where the movie almost lost me. And these are clearly evil people, and they died in their respective universe. But okay, the plot does need to happen... The worst thing though is why them? In all the universes, of all the people that know who Peter is, these are the ones coming through? Why not 97 of Uncle Ben\\'s? That would make more sense. My final complaint is that all that comes before comes to Peter is now erased, which is fine and a great hero sacrifice, but it also create issues with continuity and storylines.The great awesomeness is all the rest. The music score is amazing, best since Captain Marvel (which, no matter what you thought of that movie, has the best original score of any superhero movie). And the Flashpoint? Haha.. great stuff. The action is spectacular, the script amazing, all the actors do an fantastic job with Willem Dafoe probably stealing the acting crown. Two end-credit scenes, although I heard some saw a long \"trailer\", which I did not see so felt that was kinda weird, perhaps only in some theatres? The first meh, kinda cool I guess. The second about something I care nothing about with a character I care absolutely nothing about so kinda disappointing to me. I am not going to see Dr Strange II, I really dislike Wanda and I dislike Elizabeth Olsen portrait of her even less. That TV show was the worst I have ever seen, except for Batwoman.. nothing is worse than Batwoman... That Strange movie will suck.Despite my criticism this movie is together with the current running Hawkeye show (which is fantastic) I feel like the MCU is still alive and kicking. And with Daredevil and Kingpin now part of the MCU, can be worse for sure. This movie really take hold of you and give you that magic which the best superhero movies do. I would rank this as the second best Spider-Man movie and top 10 for sure within the MCU. 8/10 and I highly recommend.', \"That's it, I'm out. Absolute nonsense. Hey Andrew Garfield can you cry like a little girl again? I was at the point where I did not care who died or how this crap was going to end. Way to go.\", 'Throughout the story, there are tears, laughter, and heart-wrenching delight on the verge of exploding. Fans of Spider-Man will not be disappointed. Because this is possibly the most complete Spider-Man I\\'ve ever seen.We believe that Tom Holland\\'s Spider-Man is our least favorite. Peter seemed to be quite young to us. In comparison to others, it appears like his existence revolves solely around his pals. It\\'s either about school, MJ, or being an avenger\\'s enthusiast. We rarely see the gravity of his bravery.We adore Marvel\\'s take on Spider-Man as a coming-of-age story, with Tony pushing, nurturing, and seeing Spidey as a child. However, we must admit that we are looking forward to the day when this Spider-Man matures. And deserving of the title of superhero, as well as a remark like \"Tremendous power comes with great responsibility.\" It\\'s finally here, and the day has arrived.One of our favorite aspects of this installment is seeing Peter\\'s growth. Following the previous section, I\\'m still a small child with no intellect. Create general mayhem (this part is basically the same, lol), but in this sector he learnt, matured, and was brave, willing to sacrifice like a superhero. We can see that he is ready to step up and work as a team with his seniors. Tony\\'s pusher is no longer.We get to experience Tom Holland\\'s intense temperament in this part, and it has to be said that his emotive moments, his sorrowful, anger-filled eyes, and his comprehension were plain and strong. Clearly, this was not the same Spider-Man. It\\'s extremely good (albeit it\\'s unlikely to win an Oscar, as Tom claims, hehe).The plot\\'s story, which we may not be able to play sufficiently Everything appeared to rush in and then linger for a few moments. As a result, the tone and substance of the plot may be hazy. Including the action moments, which aren\\'t particularly entertaining or exciting. As a result, this section is a little hazy for us. (We believe the action scenes are the best.) There will be a lot more. After the conflict is ended, the phrase \\'Is that so?\\' enters my mind briefly.)In this part, the teaser\\'s universe does not play a prominent role. It\\'s more of a prequel to Spidey before we get into the main plot of Doctor Strange 2, which we\\'re really excited about. Who thought of Spider-Man as a way to introduce Doctor Strange? Because it\\'s Spider-Man, it knows how to play with the multiverse. Very astute. It\\'s possible to play like this. Both the tale and the hearts of the people.The major reason to watch No Way Home is because of its excellent service. He knows what viewers like us want to see since he\\'s a filmmaker. Wearing it can be considered to be limitless. I\\'m glad I got to see this at least once in my life. Because it is brimming with the sensation of being really Spider-Man. The film is interesting to movie aficionados because it pays attention to little things. And you transmit it effectively; it\\'s stunning, and we believe this emotion will linger in our minds for a long time.', \"There is nothing much to say but there is plenty to enjoy in this movie. Multiple protagonists and antagonists. Good length enough to divide with all the cast. It has surprises except for the end credit was weird.Its a must watch for all Spider Man fans.

And considering the mammoth task of juggling so many characters, the overall storyline isn\\'t bad. This could have easily been a far less focused movie tripping all over itself. However, No Way Home trips over something, that isn\\'t its own fault:\\nThe Tom Holland Spider-Man films and universe are just not very interesting. Tom Holland is an okay actor, but his tenure has suffered by having been shoehorned into the other Marvel films, never having had an origin story or even much in terms of character development or motivation.Does anyone remember how his story even began? Everyone remembers Tobey Maguire\\'s Spidey origin. You kind of remember Andrew Garfield\\'s, even if it was almost the exact same story, just less interesting.Tom Holland is a bit of blank state. He does his wide eyed stare and overexcited fast talking thing, but is given very little to work with. Most of the Marvel movies had him on as comic relief, playing second or third fiddle to their mainstay characters.His own movies likewise got bogged down in \"bathos\" humor, constantly winking at the audience and having characters break character for Family Guy style self-referential humor or \"what is happening?\" moments. They were largely plot driven films instead of character driven like the Sam Raimi films.Both Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield command the screen whenever they appear in this movie. They slip back into their roles like it was yesterday, and it truly makes me hope that Sony will be brave enough to continue their stories in their respective iterations and universes. Andrew Garfield\\'s films suffered from poor script writing, lame villains and a botched attempt at starting a cinematic universe, but he is extremely charismatic and fun to watch. He almost steals the show here.Willem Dafoe and especially Alfred Molina are fantastic here as well, while Electro and Lizard are unnecessary in an already overpopulated roster. I\\'m glad they didn\\'t throw Venom in as well (surely they were tempted to).One of the major problems here is that the villains have no relationship to Holland\\'s protagonist, and they have little to no motivation to fight someone they never met. The script demands it though, since these Marvel movies need an action scene ever 20 minutes.The parts where characters are talking are actually a lot more interesting than the fighting scenes, which just grind the narrative to a halt to throw a bunch of noisy CGI crap at the screen. This is especially frustrating at the end, where a giant brawl breaks out for no reason whatsoever right in the middle of the heroes and villains actually negotiating.Zendaya and the comic relief kid are charisma vacuums, with Zendaya failing to act as any kind of emotional anchor to the plot, and the other guy failing to be funny. When they share the screen with the characters from the previous series, it becomes painfully obvious how outclassed they are. Maguire and Dunst shared real on screen chemistry, as did Garfield and Stone.In the end, the best this film has to offer is nostalgia and *hopefully* a path to resurrect the previous Spider-Man film series as Sony does their own thing, separate from the MCU. The MCU is pretty much grasping at straws at this point and burned out much of its audience with six subpar films (Eternals, Shang Chi, Black Widow, Captain Marvel, Far from Home and even Endgame, which was a major step down from Infinity War) and who knows how much terrible filler stuff on TV.Sony would do well to pick up where they left off. A 4th Raimi Spiderman with Maguire would be a box office hit.', 'Life for Peter Parker (Tom Holland) is complicated thanks to his dual life as Spider-Man and the challenges of being in High School. Unfortunately for him; his best intentions are about to make things much worse in \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\".Taking place where \"Spider-Man: Far From Home\" ended; Peter must deal with his secret identity being leaked by Tabloid Journalist J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons); and the throngs of people, helicopters, and protestors who follow his every move and camp outside his home.As if this was not bad enough; being accused of being a murderer has drawn the attention of the authorities which further complicates his life as does returning to a school where everyone knows his identity.Desperate to get away from the constant scrutiny and observation; Peter seeks out Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch), and asks him to cast a spell that would make the world forget that Peter Parker is Spider-Man.Strange agrees but mid-spell Peter requests that there are some exemptions from the spell which include his Girlfriend MJ (Zendaya); his Aunt May (Marisa Tomei); and his friend Ned (Jacob Batalon).Strange agrees but in doing so; complications arise which allows entrants from other dimensions to enter their realm. Soon Peter is accosted by villains whom he does not know but seem to know him; that is until he is unmasked and they have no idea who this Peter Parker is before them.As more villains arrive; Peter learns of their fates in their natural dimension and is determined to save them and give them a second chance which puts him at odds with Doctor Strange who says they must go back to whatever fate they had.What follows is a descent into humor and darkness as Peter despite his best intentions sees the situation go from bad to worse and he must fight to stay true to himself and save the day.The film is a difficult one to review in the fact that there are so many surprise guests, twists, and turns that it is challenging to not reveal anything but suffice it to say that fans should absolutely enjoy it.The film takes its time getting to the action as it has a very slow and deliberate climb and Director Jon Watts is confident enough in the characters and premise that he allows ample time for the characters and setting to build and be established before he gets to the action.While there is considerable fan service in the film; it never once seems like it is pandering and it all fits very well within the story and the MCU and opens up numerous possibilities for the future.There is a mid-credit scene and a post-credit scene which is basically a trailer and both are very engaging in terms of the possibilities as Marvel has again shown that their plan of interwoven stories and characters continues to deliver and that Spider-Man still remains as popular and engaging as ever.', \"A good all round superhero action film with great special effects and cast of characters. The way it brings together the multiverse does allow for some entertaining surprises, but the lack of a new or single villain as well as the seeming invulnerability of the hero does negatively impact the tension.

It maintains comic accuracy and tom's suits are beautiful. Some scenes are absolutely heart wrenching, i found myself crying numerous times.

And then, in a weird tonal shift, the movie gets really dark, and then tries to go back to the light-hearted bit with that hanging over it, and does some more really silly stuff, and some rather confused but fast-paced action, and then goes for a sad thing that I found kinda boring, and, well, what is this supposed to *be*.It doesn't make much sense, it's tonally chaotic, and as with the previous film, the action is fleetfully enjoyable but entirely forgettable.Still, a reasonable amount of the humor works, it's fun to see the way they play with the multiverse, and there's definitely fun to be had.

Luckily throughout its duration No Way Home excels at fan pleasing moments and truly giving Peter monumental stakes and potential consequences. However it is undeniably overstuffed and choppy, as well as for me personally a lot of the MCU'isms not always particularly gelling well with the returning villains.I will be keeping the plot details vague, but for those who had expectations and ideas of what the film might be, it probably is pretty much what you expect. The opening act ripple effect of Peter's identity being revealed, with he, MJ and Ned being turned down by colleges and constant harassment sets the stage well and understandably Peter's desperation for Doctor Strange to fix it. From there the rogues gallery pour through and it's up to Peter to stop them.Here is where some of my favourite aspects of the film are, as well as my irritations. It's undeniably great seeing these characters return to the big screen, and throughout the second act it is uniquely executed and delivers some satisfying interactions between the foes (though some of their motivations could have been a bit more fleshed out), as well as time to breathe. However it is once again the abundance of joke attempts and alterations to a couple of the characters that just make some of the interactions feel awkward and cringe inducing.Doc Ock's bridge battle is a standout return and the choreography, sound design and score all intertwine nicely. Holland wasn't lying about this being a darker and more violent entry into the franchise, with the first Goblin brawl being the film's highlight, alongside the jaw-dropping visual spectacle of the mirror dimension duel. The final action set piece is pure spectacle and grin inducingly fun, it's just a shame that yet again it's another CGI heavy sequence set at night, so it's frequently hard to see what's going on at certain points.This is probably Holland's best Spider-Man performance as he really has some emotional heavy lifting to do, as well as keeping the quips and enthusiasm fresh. Willem Dafoe absolutely steals the film. He's still got all of it: the grin, the laugh, the expressions and genuine menace. Molina as well, brilliantly capturing the commanding intelligence and personality of Doc Ock and Jamie Foxx is far better suited in this iteration of Electro. Benedict Cumberbatch adds a layer of bitterness and snark to Strange, yet keeps his core values and dedication to help in check.Spider-Man: No Way Home may just be the film many fans of dreamed of. Unfortunately for me, whilst it still delivered a lot of what I wanted, I can't help but feel a bit disappointed. Dafoe & Molina prove once again why Spider-Man 1 & 2 will never be topped, the increased personal stakes for Peter are welcome and I'm still partially in awe that the film actually happened. However the leering presence of now extremely familiar and annoying MCU traits and tropes, certain character interactions and an overstuffed storyline do hold it back.\", 'Its a fine movie, but is not in the top 20 of the greatest movies of all time.

But the rest is pretty empty; it's just fanservice which plays with nostalgia and great of the past. Death of May is really not touching; we don't care about her character, that s why. Compared to death of Uncle Ben in maguire trilogy or Gwen in the amazing Spiderman, it s almost nothing in terms of emotions. Also, soundtrack seems absent, I don t remember scenes where it's in; exceptions for when old Raimi soubdtrack is played. You want to get excited? Go watch Tobey maguire's Spiderman.

I don\\'t mind Marvel films, I don\\'t even mind comics, but I don\\'t obsess over them in the way some people do (and it is fine that they get enjoyment from these films). This review is for people like myself, if you\\'re a fan of Marvel and Spiderman then - simply put - you will love the film.For me, I found I was bored. The running time is long, the story is a little \"meh\" (Spiderman wants to SAVE the villains) and everything is just a little too convenient with plot points coming that are obvious from the get go. In short: It\\'s a cookie-cut film. Marvel has their formula (and clearly it works for them) and they won\\'t stray from that. Sorry, but I am in Ridley Scott\\'s camp. There\\'s no originality anymore.By now you probably already know that other faces do pop up in the film. There are some fun scenes with these characters and I chuckled a couple of times but - the rest of the audience was whooping, cheering and clapping which actually bugged me more as - it meant I missed a lot of dialogue after a character\\'s reveal. Seriously, if you want to chat loudly - stay at home and watch the film instead of forcing others to listen to your inane thoughts.Tom Holland is good as Spiderman and, in this film, he shows a lot of range with his emotion - which was great to see because, until this film, we hadn\\'t really seen that from him but, really, he is the only positive I can think of when it comes to this film. By tomorrow, I would have forgotten most of what I\\'d just watched.It\\'s average at best. If you\\'re a fan boy, it\\'s the best Marvel film yet. Only you know which camp you belong in (and again, either camp is fine).', 'It would be unfair to say that I never really laud as great films BUT I always admire this ability to create quality escapism.With all that, I think Spider-Man: No Way Home might be the first film of that series that I actually hate .Firstly, this film feels so juvenile to the point that it is annoying. I guess this is a film not really made for me. I found the way Hollands tries to plays up the good boy persona exceedingly off-putting AND not needed. Zendaya and the Filipino guy are just a figment on its story. They even tried to gentrify the \"other\" versions of Spiderman film. Funnily, I love all the treatment for the Original Spiderman characters. Otherwise, its a mixed bag.Secondly, I found the cause of conflict in the film so unnecessary. It does not make sense for me why and how it happened. It feels like watching a cash grab for fans.I mean the conflict of the film is that his presence as a superhero has such a negative effects to their live that they were ultimately banned to their collegiate school BUT it is contrast with a rally showing their popularity too. It is like be consistent film. Even the spell is hinged on the fact that they did not plan. They go on as if this is a thing he does every time BUT he just goes for it without really thinking through of the whatnots. Ultimately, the choice of Holland Peter to armchair psychologist ughh. Just watch it, its like a Bob the Builder-esque plot line.Ultimately, what really sour me about the film is the Dr Strange Conundrum. Why even watch when the consequences can be reversed and played on? I mean, he did had some in the end BUT is it really not deserved. As a viewer, I hate it from since the Avenger films BUT I hate it more so this time, because it actively says it can AND it can even personalize it.Overall, this is a pure cash grab for people who are watching it for the characters but not the content. Its pretty much anchored on a very weak premise AND feels like a connective tissue for things to come. [0.5/5]', 'Marvel fans are just like Star Wars fans. It\\'s not surprising that both are owned by Disney and it really shows. \"He did the thing\", \"It\\'s the guy\", \"Wow they did the joke\". It\\'s just so bland and Disney is just mainstreaming everything to be some bland cash in on nostalgia. Every now and then you can see an interesting concept or a good scene shine through but more often than not, it is ruined right away by some stupid joke or switch to a funny scene. There is no character no soul left in these corporate franchises.Content like this doesn\\'t matter, it is just like another Fifa or Madden game every year. They dont care about actually creating something worthwhile.What doesn my opinion matter anyways. For every one of my opinion there are houndreds of thousands of people who have no expectations.\\n                \\n                    16 out of 27 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

(Much like what they said about the 16 before it.) Nope. I sat from almost the first 10 minutes LOVING this movie and debating if this actually beat out the magnificent 2002's Spider-Man and its even better follow-up, 2004's Spider-Man 2.I will say this: This is my new 2nd favorite of ALL 27 MCU movies. Easy. And it's easily in the top three of the 10 theatrical-released Spider-Man movies. In fact, since part 2 in 2004, I have not been impressed with any of the Spider-Man movies until Spider-Man into the Spider-Verse and this third Tom Holland-led Spider-Man series.I barely liked Tom's Spider-Man: Homecoming and I refer to it Iron Man Jr because it was WAY more about Iron Man smarts and involvement and it clearly made Peter a complete moron who couldn't lift a finger or figure out anything on his own without big-daddy Tony helping. Tom's Spider-Man: Far From Home was better, but it still couldn't let go of Tony (EVEN after his character supposedly left the franchise.) This second rebooted version of Spider-Man of Tom Holland's made me sad, because of how dumb Peter is and how reliant he is on others, namely big-daddy Tony. This is NOT the brilliant Peter Parker I grew up with.But, FINALLY...they got it right with Tom's third movie. The trailer spoiled SO MUCH of this movie and the actors involved, as trailers are designed to be spoiler packed (usually the very last scene of the movie is in the trailer,) so I won't even go into the synopsis or what happens or who's in it. I just HIGHLY encourage you to see this ASAP and know: they FINALLY got Spider-Man right. After 5 disappointing follow-ups to Spider-Man 2, THEY FINALLY GOT SPIDER-MAN BACK ON TRACK.I laughed so hard, even though it wasn't like the traditional MCU movie where it's mostly a comedy. These were genuine jokes and not just inserted to please the audience who apparently wants more comedic MCU movies than action-packed Super-Hero movies. I cried a bit, even though it's mostly an uplifting movie. And yes, I marveled on how well acted and written this film is. Everybody gave it their 110% and no one stole scenes or out-performed anyone else. This was MY Endgame event.I loved this movie so much, I probably will buy it right away on Blu upon release. And to give you a hint of how much that is to me: I don't really buy Blurays anymore due to the convenience of streaming and of ALL 27 MCU movies, I only bought two so far. The rest, I can watch online if I feel like it. Most are forgettable, anyways.I heard they're building a new trilogy with Tom Holland continuing his role as Spidey. To be frank, before this viewing, I almost didn't want to see them. If this turned out just slightly better than Tom's 2nd one which was just slightly better than his mediocre 1st one, I was pretty much done.Now, my Spidey-Sense is tingling to see what they have in store for us next.\", 'I decided to go see this movie because of the 8.9 rating, which was based on more than 200,000 reviews.

I heard that some people actually left the theater out of boredom. I assume the high rating was only possible because of such strong a fandom.

Literally nothing is holding this film back which the script contains about everything. And director Jon Watts making the best spider man movie ever. Fans and non fans are going to love the film. The story is best to go without any spoilers. There are many surprises that will leave the crowd cheering. Story also goes into an emotional direction and making the film feeling like a conclusion to the trilogy. Characters story arcs coming to an end. While opening up more possibilities to where the direction can go.No Way Home does the third film of concluding the story right unlike Amazing Spider man movie or the original third film where they cram up so many villains and a story that can barely hold it together. No Way Home script managed to balance the story and characters out. This film does have several villains. A lot of returning villains that is a lot of fun surprises and even with a new look. Peter Parker facing each one of them and trying to stop them is awesome. The plot is great. It can try to go in a emotional direction. There is also a fun brief appearance of another character which is cool to see and hoping to see more of them in future mcu films someday.The action sequences are awesome and stylistic. Spider man fight scenes are amazing. The visual effects are brilliant. The cinematography is well done in capturing the action scenes. The music score is different by Michael Giacchino but great. The cast ensemble did a great job. Like I said earlier, the appearances making a return is a lot of fun. For a long run time, the film does feel short and very fast moving which keeps your eyes glued to the screen.The climax battle is epic and exciting. Spider Man facing multiple villains is one of the best action scenes ever. It can be a bit dark. The action scene with Spider Man and Doctor Strange chasing each other through the mirror dimension is stunning.Overall, No Way Home is one of the best Marvel films ever. And one of the best Spider man movies. It is big, epic, and the script and direction had a lot of surprises. I am hoping to see Jon Watts take on another Marvel project.There is a fun mid credit scene that hints for where the direction can go. And a post credit scene that hints of where mcu is going next.', \"VFX and sound is awesome as always. However, the story is forgettable and hard to relate. Peter is very annoying for the whole first act and although he's there for the second and third act, somehow his presence disappears. I watched it on IMAX just to see if I'd enjoy it fully, but nope. I'd prefer Eternals over this one. There are some emotional moments that are nicely done. You feel the heartbreak for sure. Some moments on the other hand feels fake. Dr. Octopus talks too much that he becomes annoying as well.

Tobey Maguire's Spidey became a memory, nostalgia for the kids who are adults now. After that so-so, decent Amazing Spider-Man, Marvel Studios brought this popular character in Avengers' Universe with Captain America: Civil War (2014) and MCEU fans went crazy. The Superhero got his own films Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man (2019), which made Tom Holland a household name. These films had that heroic touch of Iron Man (perhaps the most popular Avenger for the Fans), and now we have No Way Home as a whole new crazy Universe post Endgame. If you love Spider-Man movies, if you love Marvel movies, if you love Doctor Strange and if you love all those villains you saw in Spidey films over the years, then you are gonna enjoy this film like a festival. One hell of cobweb it is, and the Superlative Spidey smashes it in style. But, he is not alone. This is Holland's first Spider-Man film where Tony Stark does not appeared, but still he is not alone. Jon Watts, Marvel and Sony have delivered us a Gigantic Blockbuster Spider-Man Saga as a Christmas Present in advance.Spider-Man: No Way Home trailer was full of story, yet it has a lot of surprises stored for the final product. In the end credit scene of Far From Home we saw Parker being exposed, and now in No Way Home he wants people to forget that. He asks Dr. Stephen Strange makes his identity as Spider-Man a secret again with magic but an overload of time dimensions breaks open the multiverse and allows five supervillains from alternate realities to enter Parker's universe. Parker has to battle out the mess he has created and what more surprises he has to offer, must be kept secret by me. Yes, no spoilers at all. They are busy trending #DontSpoilNoWayHome on Twitter and I respect that. Chris McKenna and Erik Sommers' writing keeps you extremely busy during the watch, while the screenplay has no dull moments whatsoever. Just one condition, you don't have to look for the logic because you're watching a Marvel/Sony's Superhero film, not Christopher Nolan's Cinema.Sony and Marvel Entertainment have made a fantastic film like Spider-Man: Into The Spider Verse (animation), which may remain unbeatable for years. No Way Home is like a Feature Film version of that intelligently nutty film. If I have to pick the best Feature Film (Superhero) recently, then No Way Home certainly tops the list. Jon Watts brings the madness of multiverse and passion of Spider-Verse together in MCU's Spider-Man No Way Home. A combination that will leave fans screaming out for the repeat watch. No Way Home is packed with solid action, fantastic story, lots of surprises; plenty of Heroic stuff, large size explosions, king-size entertainment and last but not the least, touching emotions. It saves a lot of cliches from becoming cliches. The climax will break the hearts of many Spidey fans but that's where the cinematic magic lies. You need an USP factor beyond that regular commercial potboiler, that's what it is. No Way Home will unite Avengers Fans and old Spidey Fans, and this Union is gonna explode at the box office. As a whole, Spider-Man: No Way Home is a smashing Blockbuster. MCU's most exhilarating entertainer post Endgame phenomena and believe it or not, it has the same amount of fans-crazy hysteria. Just go on hooting, no matter how much the ticket costs because the show worths it.RATING - 7/10*\", \"The 9/10 rating on here shows how manipulated these ratings are.This film was so boring and dragged out, and there was no point to any of it.So much cgi it was like watching a cartoon much of the time.If I'd not been with my daughter I'd have left half way through.I genuinely struggled to stay awake and felt angry at how bad it was by the end.Tom was great as always, but the film sucked.\\n                \\n                    26 out of 49 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

A stunning achievement in pushing forward while also acknowledging the past, things here might not be perfect but there's too much to like here to deny that Marvel has once more raised the bar for the comic book cinematic landscape.4 imprisoned trees out of 5Check out my film blog Jordan and Eddie for more reviews!\", 'Look at the shiny-shiny ... and then it all unfolded with a tedious inevitability - (sound familiar?).

This is NOT a so-called \"Spider-Man\" movie - it doesn\\'t stand by itself nor was it capable of ever standing by itself, and it did what all bloat-budget projects do on the precipice of falling flat: used other franchises to prop it up, resorted to bit-part novelty, installed an enormous dose of silliness, and, essentially, threw everything at it in order to distract and disguise its blatant, copious failings. I\\'ve grown tired of movies relying on CGI Hero Landing poses, quips, and ridiculous set-ups; truly, with such a budget, why can these people not develop an actual story, a story with substance, meaning, and purpose? Why is there no proof-reading-editor-director-producer with a modicum of intelligence to address the profuse series of ridiculous, asinine, preposterous, discrepant, and utter puerile nonsense shoehorned and stapled together sequence of scenes that they packed together and served up as the best ever movie ever made in the history of cinema everywhere for ever, and ever, amen. Honestly now people, those rating this as a triumph, oh come on, you do realise that this is not the most spectacular moment in your life, right?

It is definitely my favorite of the Tom Holland films, and a shade under Spiderman 2 as the best one yet. To see Alfred Molina, William Dafoe and Jamie Foxx reprising their roles, was INSANE. Each of their entrances caused goosebumps and their acting, pure nostalgia! Props to Dafoe! His voice and facial expressions remains perfect for the Goblin 20 years later. Really, the reality where we see these characters together is unthinkable, yet here we have it, and the film ensures its more than fan service! Spiderman, choosing to 'cure' gives these characters a shot at the main theme of the film, redemption. This brings us to the grandest (& most spoiled) reveal in recent years, the appearance of the other Spidermen! It is difficult to comprehend and put into words the feeling of seeing Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield suit up. Filmmakers even graces its fans by showing PLENTY of these Parkers as they play huge roles in the third act, complimenting the emotional themes of the film. In fact, my favorite redemption story arch was that of Andrew's. I was blown away by how invested he was. When he caught Zendaya's MJ, his outpour of raw emotions sent shivers down my spine. It was gratifying to see the filmmakers give him justice. Another positive is we finally have a mature version of Tom Holland's Spidey. We see his mistakes and struggles to confront its consequences, themes of a grounded and relatable superhero we love and admire.All positives mentioned, the film does have shortcomings in its plot. There were moments I feel unnecessary like Aunt May's demise, Sandman's motivation and everything Ned. The premise that 'too many requests' during the spell casting ushered the multiverse crisis had a weak hold on me, and to blame it on Spiderman was a head scratcher. The film does however, a tremendous job of giving us things to love to overcome these holes. The sheer volume of iconic characters is a remarkable feat no one thought possible.Spiderman: No Way Home is then, a well packaged present as it delivers what both hardcore and casual fans want and desire. And for that, I give a score of 8.5/10.\", 'How he deatroys the universe because he wanted his girlfriend to remember him. Then he wanted to change the super vilans who are already DEAD.

There's no denying that. Ever since this movie's announcement, you knew this was a bigger deal than the usual superhero flicks. And being a movie with such high expectations, means that there's so much room for things to go wrong. And unfortunately... It seems like it did.Now I'm fresh out of the theatre, and I already feel like this movie had so much potential wasted. A sentiment I also share towards Avengers Endgame; where the only thing the writers seemed to worry about was 'fan-service'. Fan service is fine honestly, but the line should be when fan-service slowly starts taking over for storytelling. Because the storytelling in this movie was childish.Don't get me wrong... I enjoyed the movie... I enjoyed the theatre experience... It was fun... But fun is not enough when you realize what could have been. Spiderman: No Way Home could have been Marvel's most ambitious project yet, but it has the curse of Marvel's horrible writing staff who similarly messed up everything from Avengers Endgame, to WandaVision, to Falcon and the Winter Soldier, to Loki and to Black Widow. The plot of the movie sounds like some cheap fan fiction that somehow got made. And what's even worse is its absolutely cringe worthy dialogue; existing for the sole purpose of reminding the audience of previous Spiderman movies. It's such a dumb and convenient plot that just exists for the sake of nostalgia.I loved Avengers Infinity War and I really enjoyed Spiderman Far From Home, but I haven't enjoyed a single Marvel project since, because all their projects have been so shallow with no real substance to back itself up. Marvel has a writing problem that needs to be looked into, for the sake of cinema and storytelling.What a missed opportunity... What an absolutely missed opportunity...\", \"This film releases unique emotions and also a disproportionate number of scenes of applause and tears. The film is very moving and exciting and the characters are all there so you can't tell them anything. The plot based on healing the baddies and not defeating them is quite original even if it has a meaningless beginning. For the rest this negative film has that the dialogues are disgusting for most of the film and the villains are not managed so well, but it is overcome because in the end the film lives up to expectations and with an exaggeration of fan service.\", 'Tom Holland is completed unacceptable as Spiderman.

I was never bored while watching it and the plot seemed interesting enough. The only moment I had an issue with was when Peter suddenly went into a blinding murderous rage when green goblin showed up but suddenly calmed down and decided not to stab him through with the glider. From the point where Aunt May dies to the end of the movie, we barely get glimpses of how Peter Parker is feeling. He is seen having playful banter with the other spidermen and barely seems angry even right after aunt may dies. He seems more sad then angry even as the other peter parkers tell him not to go murder people. It was such a jarring tonal shift that it took me out of the movie when Peter started beating up on Green Goblin (which doesnt even make sense because green goblin was far stronger than him in the earlier scene and nothing has changed).After a bit more thinking about the movie, I realized that so much of this movie is flawed. I will say, the action is good, the acting is good (andrew garfield plays a better spiderman than both tom holland and tobey maguire), and the film is shot well however the film severely lacks quality in the writing department.The whole movie happens because of ridiculously dumb decisions made by both peter parker and dr strange. The spell that is used is not explained nearly enough to have the end solution (everyone forgetting peter parker) make any logical sense. In the scene where tom holland was given that ultimatum, I felt more confused by the reasoning than moved by the sacrifice he was making. Peter tries to \"save\" these villains but he doesn\\'t even attempt to get to know these villain\\'s stories. Aunt may tells him its his responsibility to save these people because they are lost or at least norman is but Peter only realizes he needs to be saving these people because he is sending them to die, but Sandman doesn\\'t even die and neither does the lizard. Sure the lizard is better off cured, but peter didnt talk to him enough to even understand why.This contrived plot line takes up a fair bit of the movie before norman goes evil and tells the other villains that they dont need to be cured and suddenly the lizard leaps out of the car like its planned, doc oc just runs off into the night after getting shocked a bit and sandman flees just for kicks while spiderman fights green goblin.And then aunt may dies and its sad and she basically gives the great power great responsibility line and tells peter its his duty to save those people.And then hes sad, the other spidermen show up, they work on cures for everyone and then the have the final fight.This plot just did not work for me at all.', 'NO SPOILERS - The first act is a mess saved by some familiar faces and one or two funny scenes. However, with the first emotional event of the film, everything changes. First, with a lot of fan service and some weird changes on the tone (I still don\\'t get how MCU wants everybody to move from crying a lot to laughing hard in the next minute), but always growing to a very strong third act on an epic battle (even if slightly confusing).There are problems. The fan service - already mentioned - is simply too much. It\\'s not only what you are thinking. It\\'s remembering all the single moments you can imagine, it\\'s in a lot of dialogue, lots of lines and mostly is there only to tell you \"hey, I\\'m here, remember?\". But what works mainly as a gimmick supports a very good emotional arc, which happens for the first time on this trilogy. This also helps Holland and Zendaya, who are now better actors and have time to show what they can bring to the table.It\\'s not a perfect film. It\\'s still behind the first two of Maguire but I hope they can keep on this way.PS: The humour is still an issue, but a bit less than on the previous ones.', 'Great storyline, absolutely loaded with an ALL STAR CAST. It was amazing to see all the villains from the previous movies return and the chemistry between Toby, Andrew and Tom was not only hilarious but genuine and fantastic. They really listened to the fans on the one. Toby and Andrew have much bigger parts than I expected which made this movie for me. When they showed up in the movie the cinema absolutely erupted. It was a very special moment - one guy in my row was crying. Not to mention Dr Strange is not only brilliant in this movie but also has a huge part himself. This is quite possibly the best Marvel to date.', 'I am rarely motivated to take the time to rate/review movies. So the fact that I am even here typing this should tell you something. I ended up watching this movie because my child wanted to watch this so badly, citing the excellent ratings on IMDB as a reason to tell me it was worth the risk of covid exposure in a theater. I really wonder how is it even possible that people would rate this movie a 10/10 unless they are such die hard Marvel fans that they are ready to rave about anything that Marvel sends their way. Just to be clear, I have myself thoroughly enjoyed a lot of Marvel movies/series. The plot in this movie seemed like it was made up just to create a spiderman sequel. The plot seemed so dumb and lack luster. The background score seemed annoying at times. And as other reviews have pointed out, it was like someone had to tell us when exactly to laugh for what was an intended joke and on more than one occasion, the scene was a few seconds longer than it needed to be and it felt so awkward. I did not hear a single person actually laugh to any of the jokes in the theater and there were lots of people in the theater. I think this is probably the worst Marvel movie I have seen and by far.', '\"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is an Action - Fantasy movie and the third movie of the \"Spider-Man\" franchise, in which we follow the story of Spider-Man after \"Spider-Man: Far from Home\". Everybody knows the true identity of Spider-Man and Doctor Strange can help Peter with a spell. Everything change when this spell goes wrong.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had an amazing plot, contained plenty of action scenes and much of suspense. Regarding the plot, there were some plot twists that I did not expect so, it was a nice surprise and something that made the movie even more interesting and enjoyable. The direction which was made by Jon Watts was very good and he used wisely both information and characters to create this special movie. The interpretations of Tom Holland who played as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, Alfred Molina who played as Dr. Otto Octavius / Doc Ock, Benedict Cumberbatch who played as Doctor Strange and Willem Dafoe who played as Norman Osborn / Green Goblin were simply fantastic and their combination worked very well and created an outstanding result. All in all, I have to say that \"Spider-Man: No Way Home\" is one of the best Marvel movie and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it.', \"No Way Home was a great film! The interaction and relationship between the three Spider-Men was the best part of the movie. However, neither is this the best comic book movie nor is it the best Marvel movie. There some plot holes that hold this movie back. For example, Ned being able to all of a sudden open portals following the underwhelming entries of Tobey and Andrew. There are some factors that hold this movie back. On a different note, Tom Holland's acting was incredible, and the overall storyline was pretty well done.\", \"In summary this movie was well received and for good reason because it's a solid good movie. With that being said it wasn't great and it wasn't the best spiderman movie. It heavily relied on nostalgia to carry the plot and development and while I can appreciate it all it didn't exactly climax as I was hoping for. Felt like the marvel series as of late just compiled into a movie instead of episodes.Tom holland uses up the last of his awkward teen spiderman attitude in a overdue effort for his character to finally start truly evolving. Yet it comes pretty slow over the course of this film. Additionally, the main conflicts in this movie basically are all spidermans faults when you really think about it which makes it even less of a plot arch due to the circular reasoning behind the movie.Nostalgically it carries the film for obvious reasons and while I loved what happens I feel like it wasn't as wholesome as I expected it to be.. I guess I just got a high expectation from all the great feedback of the film.There were some glaring issues with the plots reasoning and motivations but I get it. Overlooking some of those things it felt like this film was just a filler marvel movie to set up for the next phase and it showed up in its quality. Felt more like a movie special for tom holland instead of a side series that marvel did for loki, wandavision, wintersoldier, and hawkeye. Basically the same quality and effort except instead of a series you got a movie with nostalgia.It was still a solid film to watch but not exactly top tier from marvel. Still loved the nostalgic parts though! They might have carried this movie but it worked!\", 'Movie was excellent for the most part. STRONGLY recommend watching the all the Sami Raimi spiderman and amazing spiderman movies leading up to this one as no way home is tied to those movies and a continuing of them to some extent. I did myself but I have movie amnesia and I forgot nearly everything that happened in those movies lol. It did confuse me seeing the other spiderman\\'s bring up events and characters in their respective movies.No Way Home was literally unskippable, The MCU has always given us excellent \"3rd installment\" movies. See: Ragnarok, Civil War, Infinity War and now this.Seeing the 3 spidey\\'s together is an all time great cinema moment. Dafoe stole the show as Normald Oswald and The Green Goblin with his masterful Hyde/Jekyll dynamic with a dash of Ledger\\'s joker mixed in. Wish sandman had more screen-time. Luckily the other spiderman 3 is still around and the CGI holds up well even after 15+ years.The real problem with the movie is how much focus, emphasis, and reliability was on Dr. Strange. Peter went to Strange to fix the issues and went back to him to fix them yet again. Idk what the movie writers were thinking giving so much screen-time and power over the plot to another hero character that wasn\\'t even the main focus of the movie. At times it truly felt like I was watching a Dr. Strange movie. Yes, I am aware Dr. Strange was trapped in another dimension for a period of time but that doesn\\'t disapprove my points.Didn\\'t help seeing Strange casually one shot one of the vintage spiderman villains when he trapped him in that glass thingy. Everyone knows Dr. Strange is several tiers above spiderman (their small tangle was plot biased in favor of spiderman as this was a spiderman movie after all) on the power scale and that scene proved Strange could have solo\\'d spiderman\\'s rouge\\'s gallery without much difficulty but the plot wouldn\\'t let him for obvious reasons.That being said, the overwhelming influence Strange had over a movie that wasn\\'t even his was briefly band aided when Spiderman trapped him in another dimension and the vintage villains and spidermans showed up and etc, but Strange showed up and saved the day once again. Now imagine if he was died in that dimension, everything would be screwed and spiderman by himself couldn\\'t do anything about it but use talk no justsu to try to save and convince the villains to change for the better.Dr. Strange single-handedly created the movies plot and issues and he single-handedly destroyed it by the end of it. This is exactly why I think his name definitely deserves to be in the movie\\'s title.', 'Top quality and not at all what I was expecting. Great cast, well acted with some nice little twists.

No hate to Marvel or anything, their movies usually don\\'t have very good writing.1. Actually becoming Spider-Man: This was the biggest factor of the movie for me. For a long time we\\'ve had a heavy influence from Iron Man which led to this weird combo character where Spider-Man was also kind of Iron Man and while I loved those films I didn\\'t like that aspect of it. This movie takes that factor and throws it in the garbage. Having Peter help the villains was the best decision for this movie because like MJ says, \"that\\'s who he is.\" This movie is full of who Spider-Man is and why we all love him. He tries to help everyone even if it doesn\\'t directly involve him because \"With great power comes great responsibility.\" Throughout the film he is trying to help MJ and Ned with no thoughts to his own happiness because \"that\\'s who he is.\" When everyone forgets him we have Spider-Man on his own and we finally get the Spider-Man that we can recognize. At the very core of this movie is Spider-Man becoming who he is and I am glad we finally get to see it.2. Peter\\'s character development: This movie has a very clear arc for Peter. Everything goes wrong because he want\\'s the people he loves to remember that he is Spider-Man. At the end of the movie he is willing to give up everything that he was fighting for and have everyone forget who he is- a selfless act in a sea of selfish ones. By the movie allowing Peter to make mistakes- and big ones- the audience gets a chance to see Peter become who he needs to be. Before this movie there was a pretty big problem: how could they get Peter to go away from Iron Man and become Spider-Man? This is how. Peter Parker makes mistakes all the time, that\\'s why people relate to him and that\\'s why his journey is so satisfying. The ending to this movie is bittersweet but it is a perfect ending because we can see the Peter Parker that is familiar to us and we see him grow through his mistakes and become a better person, a selfless person, because of them.3. The story makes sense: Maybe it\\'s just me but I remember watching the part of this movie where Peter has Doctor Strange cast that spell and I thought \"this is exactly what I would do.\" Peter wants the best for MJ and Ned, of course he would get Doctor Strange to cast a dangerous spell for them. Of course he wants them to remember him as Spider-Man, that was the way their relationships all grew. I will admit that there are some parts of this story that didn\\'t really make sense- like why Doctor Strange didn\\'t just wait for Peter to tell him the conditions before casting the spell, or why he couldn\\'t add that MJ and Ned would still remember Peter during the spell at the end. But overall I think the story made sense for a teenager that just had his world torn apart.4. Every character has a story: Marvel often falls victim to one dimensional bad guy syndrome. All 3 of the Spider-Man movies squash that problem by making the villains somewhat like-able with motivations better than \"I want to take over the world\" (kind of with the exception of Mysterio, no hate Far From Home.) This movie turns that up to the max. The only 1D characters in this movie are the lizard and electro. Everyone else has internal conflict, everyone else has a personality. In a movie with this many characters that is hard to pull off, and it is very impressive.These reasons are why I think this movie has good writing. We see a character that actually struggles and develops, that has motivations that make sense, and that stays true to the source material. On top of all this we have all of the appearances, some very funny moments, a Spider-Man story with more consequences and higher stakes than ever before, great acting, fun fight scenes, and a great score. The movie also keeps to the story about Holland\\'s Peter Parker, a difficult task considering everything that could of outshined him. At the end of the day the movie is still about him. Honestly, what else could you want from a Marvel movie?', \"This movie has it all. I went through a wide range of emotions and all while having fun. There are no points at which I'm asking myself why did I watch this movie (or pay to).

I think the movie is just as mediocre as the previous two. But it will not have the same score as its prequels for the inflated valuation it has had, as it happened to Endgame.No Way Home has been \"more than a movie.\" It has been pure and simple fan service. I think if you take away from what this movie stands out for, it\\'s kind of absurd. But that has been the magic that has wrapped this film. Ever since Tom Holland donned the arachnid suit, there has been an endless debate between which of the 3 Spider-man seen on the big screen is the best. Everyone would rather say their favorite than have some objectivity.For me, Holland and Garfield films are not even the Raimi ones; others prefer Garfield\\'s youthful and hooligan tone, and others prefer an even more youthful Spider-man in relation to the world\\'s great superheroes, such as Holland\\'s. Garfield\\'s also shared similar characteristics to Holland\\'s but Garfield\\'s is the most affected of all by having a terrible production and direction, so much so that they didn\\'t even bother to carry out the projects they had of him and they left it in oblivion to forever.This film has been a cinematic event, no matter who it may be, and no matter how bad it is. This movie does not answer the question of who is better Spider-man. Nor does it add fuel to the fire by calling for debate. This movie reconciles the fans. He suggests that you put aside the prejudices that you have had with one and the other and reunite them in an adventure (which also makes you turn a blind eye to the script), where the writers show that they have put effort and affection in the scenes where they talk together. In the meeting, in the laboratory, in the final battle ... their dialogues, their gestures ... seeing them on the big screen again after so long, fills you with emotion.Not just from the Spider-men. Seeing his villains also makes you smile. Alfred Molina as Otto is sensational again despite the fact that he could have appeared more after the attack at Pete\\'s house; Literal Norman stealing the movie being the main villain (I almost had a fit when he stabbed Tobey\\'s Spider-man, damn it. I thought, I haven\\'t waited 20 years for this, don\\'t kill him!), With that giggle and Goblin expression; Seeing Electro\\'s Jaimie Foxx has also been emotional despite the fact that his character is somewhat absurd in his original film ... and I would like to say the same about The Sandman and The Lizard, but it is that, at least with the Sandman, I didn\\'t like what they did with him.From the moment the Sandman is CGI and Thomas Haden Church didn\\'t appear, I could smell what they wanted to do. And the same with the Lizard although this is a Lizard, that he gives more. And well, collecting the frames of his appearances in the original films seemed to me an impressive crap. I suppose they have not appeared for reasons of contract or personal.Anyway, I know that this film is not what is read by networks, much less, that the majority of votes are for pure fanservice, but what do you want me to tell you, I am glad that this film exists. Seeing not only Tobey Maguire putting on the suit, but also Andrew, fills me with joy, you don\\'t know how much. I do not care that the plot of the film is based on the fact that a child does not know what to do with his wishes and affects the universes in that way; I do not care if Peter\\'s repellent high school friends reappear because in this installment they do not appear so much, and I even do not care that, except for the main heroes, the farewells of the villains are somewhat anticlimactic and that some dialogues are forced no, the following (Jaimie Foxx talking about the black Spider-man) and that the film falls into constant inconsistencies.I am grateful to Marvel for delivering this cinematic event to us. Thank you for adding the universes from these movie sagas to the MCU, whether you like them or not. Seeing this data, dreaming is free, and who knows if Marvel has any surprises for us and we will see these heroes again. You live on dreams.PS: And doing the joke, now that they belong to the MCU, Raimi\\'s Spider-man movies become the best trilogy. I\\'m gone.', 'Very good movie, enjoyed it a lot.

Tobey and Maguire's Spider-Mans didn't really feel like the same versions from all those years ago, or at least that's what I feel. And the villains were all meh except for Doc Oc and Green Goblin, but even these villains weren't as great as they were before. Everything feels watered down in my opinion, and the stakes were just not high enough for me to take enough interest.There are some nice nostalgia scenes and good action pieces, but that's pretty much it. The acting feels cheesy most of the time and there's way too much crying, some people may not mind the amount of crying, but they are really trying to exaggerate the emotions.Spider-Man: No Way Home is a decent movie, 5/10 - 6/10; nowhere near an 8.5. It had the concept but not the execution. It all seems more like nostalgia-bait more than anything. It is worth a watch at the end of the day, so I'd give it a recommendation to all the Spider-Man fans.\", 'As a huge Doctor Strange fan who is more than ready for more of the multiverse, I had very high expectations for No Way Home. Unfortunately, it was a let down. Sure it caters to fans with some nostalgic moments, but relies way way way too much on the fan service while lacking in pretty much all other areas. The story was all over the place, pacing was very wishy-washy, and the writing was horrendous for the most part. It felt very childish and cheap at a lot of moments with jokes that just did not land at all and some super corny dialogue. My best friend and I were genuinely confused at the amount of laughs, cheers, and claps from our audience in the theater tonight (and we are both very big Marvel fans, my best friend being a long-time, devoted spidey fan). So believe me when I tell you that we really wanted to love this movie. Honestly our favorite part of the entire film was the post-credits features. If anything, this movie only further solidified my belief that Tom Holland is the weakest of the Spider-Mans. Not necessarily his fault, but rather the fault of the writers for trying way too hard to make him a quirky, shy, stuttery, awkward teenager and not giving him any real development or depth to his character aside from maybe the two seconds after May\\'s death and his fight with Osborn where we see a glimpse of a dark side in him, but that\\'s it. Additionally, killing off May was just so lame. It reeked of \"we need to kill off a character for some kind of shock value but not anyone too important\". Another moment that I don\\'t understand is when Toby is seemingly fatally injured in a sudden and surprising moment towards the end of the film, but then is all of a sudden okay a few minutes later? There were just too many moments that felt like it was relying on audience reactions and surprise in order to come across as a good movie. I think the main reason it is receiving such praise right now is because of the current hype around Andrew and Toby reprising their roles (which was great fun don\\'t get me wrong), but in the long run didn\\'t feel like it served much of a purpose to the actual story beyond wanting to drop a bombshell on fans. By the fifth conversation/conflict about how Peter can \"cure\" the villains and save the world, the entire movie became a jumbled and chaotic mess. Interesting concept but executed poorly.', \"Does this really deserve a higher rating than something like spiderman into the spiderverse or infinity war?Yes its a good movie 7/10but just because it has a lot of fan service and nostalgia doesn't mean it deserves its rating.The story was predictable but it picked up, good movie but doesn't deserve the insane hype.\\n                \\n                    29 out of 59 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Spider-Man: No Way Home is a fanservice galore fest done extremely well with jokes, emotion, and heart added to the mix. Not only giving closure to so much of Spider-Man's character, but also for the fans who always wondered how certain things would play out if they happened. This is a movie you need to witness.Picking up right off from Spider-Man: Far from Home, the film gets straight into action with dealing on consequences and trying to amend outcomes. In some ways similar to Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, the film stays interesting from scene after scene and never misses a beat. Solid action set pieces and character interactions give the film a lot of fun things to work with, and by the end everyone was clapping and cheering.Without spoilers, No Way Home will please most people who are familiar with all the previous Spider-Man films. I got a little emotional and attached when certain characters popped up again and I definitely didn't feel the movie was a quick-in cashgrab at all. The performances were all really good, the special effects were top notch, and some of the music will be familiar to the fans.In the end, it proves Marvel can still pull off a really entertaining yet rewarding movie for Spider-Man fans. Some minor criticisms I have is there are a few contrivances and maybe some characters could have gotten a bit more screentime, but in the end I had such a blast with what the movie set out to do. No Way Home will probably be my favourite film of 2021. Try to go without spoilers though, it will be more satisfying.8.5/10.\", 'This was one of the best Marvel movies ever - Funny, Emotional and Highly Nostalgic.Loved how all the characters got closure and it was just brilliantly unbelievable to see our favourite characters from 20 years ago.\\n                \\n                    12 out of 21 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

After \"Avengers Endgame\" the quality of most MCU films was extremely disappointing in my eyes. Neither films nor series could really convince me. But my last hope rested on the third and (for now?) last \"Spider-Man\" film with Tom Holland. And who would have thought it, but \"No Way Home\" (2021) made it! The film refreshed the MCU and in my opinion is the best thing Marvel has done in a long time in so many ways. But where do you start with this film? Difficult, because it\\'s hard to tell anything about the story without spoilers, so I\\'ll go into spoilers later, but of course point them out first.Peter\\'s identity was revealed by Mysterio and now he has to live with the consequences. His personal life is over, but so are his friends MJ and Ned. And if that wasn\\'t enough, many people believe that Peter killed Mysterio. Spidey sees no alternative but to seek out Doctor Strange. Because he might have a solution for his problem...It\\'s almost impossible to go into the film without any prior knowledge, because the trailers alone tell you very clearly what to expect. But of course they don\\'t reveal everything, which I at least welcome. Still, I recommend anyone who hasn\\'t seen the trailer (if thats even an option for anyone) to avoid it and go into the movie as fresh as possible.\"No Way Home\" is the third film in this still quite young trilogy, which actually doesn\\'t really work without the \"Avengers\" films (and many other individual films from the MCU), but you can say that we all have a real, complete Spider-Man series for the first time. Both the Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield films ended quite openly. And while Tom Holland will certainly continue, this film is a kind of conclusion for the Avengers-Spidey.The story in this film takes on unexpected dimensions and for a long time I had the feeling that there were real stakes. I noticed that especially with the action. A lot of Marvel movies have those clearly defined action moments that are meant to look cool and epic (so you can put them into the trailers), but here the Peter Parker story came first. Each scene seemed like a natural progression from the one before, and I really liked that. I also think it\\'s great that Tom Holland\\'s character has to face the biggest challenges since Thanos. It\\'s his film and his story. And it has never been as good as it is here. Holland is a great actor who has been fantastic as Spider-Man so far, but it\\'s only here that I think he really matures into a character. The rest of the cast is great too, I really like Zendaya and Jacob Batalon in this film and they also develop into fleshed out characters.But that\\'s not all: The action and the visuals of the film have improved. While technically good, the first two Spidey films were never as impressive as Sam Raimi\\'s trio. Here, however, some people seem to have really thought about it. \"No Way Home\" is visually very impressive, wild and at times beautiful. Michael Giacchino (again) does a great job with his score and lets the Spidey theme sound really powerful with a few moments of goosebumps.The film isn\\'t quite perfect, as many logic gaps are opened up in order to advance the story. BUT: That never bothered me because the fun, the emotions and the huge surprises were more than worth it. A movie has to entertain me and \"No Way Home\" did that every second. And that\\'s exactly why I forgive the film\\'s small weaknesses. Also, in an MCU film with magic and spider powers, you have to accept some supernatural and crazy things.But from here I have to enter spoiler territory. So if you haven\\'t seen the film yet, you should NOT read on and jump to the conclusion. Here\\'s your warning, so go ahead!SPOILER Alert!It was clear from the trailers that there would be an overlap with the previous Spidey universes. But even before that, there was speculation, fantasizing and there were first leaks. I think that\\'s why everyone wanted to see this film. But despite all the fantastic appearances, \"No Way Home\" is still a film that not only does (great) fan service, but creates a new story with old characters. Especially the villains from the Raimi and Marc Webb universe refresh the whole thing nicely. Alfred Molina as Doc Ock and Willem Dafoe as Osborne are the stars here, but Jamie Foxx as Electro also gets a new take on his character. Sandman and the Lizard are there and the actors (Thomas Haden Church and Rhys Ifans) give their voice for them, but the ending shots with the actors were (unfortunately) used from earlier films. At least we get to enjoy J. K. Simmons again as J. Jonah Jameson. This time he is a paranoid maniac who spreads consiracy theories, but it works.In addition, the idea that all villains should be healed is really great. No typical good versus evil, but Holland\\'s Peter Parker wants to give these antagonists a new chance. At the same time, however, he is also struggling with the consequences of his leaked identity.But what would this film be without the appearances of Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield? How much I wished for that and it came true. And both aren\\'t just simple cameos, they both have integral roles in the story. And this is where the magic of the film comes into play. Something like this will probably never happen again, it\\'s unique. And I never thought that Marvel could make me feel this overflowing enthusiasm again, like last time in \"Endgame\". Seeing Tobey Maguire again as Spider-Man was magical. And Garfield gets to save MJ in free fall, bringing some closure to his trauma with Gwen. Absolutely fantastic!The question is, of course, is it possible to see and enjoy the film without the Maguire and Garfield films? Yes. But of course the effect without these films isn\\'t even remotely as great. And honestly, what Spidey fan hasn\\'t seen the other movies? There\\'s even a small, funny reference to Miles Moralis.SPOILERS end!Conclusion: What a movie. What a Spider-Man movie. \"No Way Home\" was the most fun I had in the cinema since \"Endgame\". Marvel still has this magical potential somehow and director Jon Watts got almost everything out of this story.

The reunion was so special to see, it was wonderful to see the previous 2 spidermans in this movie. I really, really loved it. It proves that it is not always bad to bring back some of the elements, characters or even actors from the previous movies. It takes skill to implement old elements, treat them with respect and make them turn out great in a new movie. The fact that Andrew's Peter Parker saved this universe's MJ was a touch that must have had long-time fans (me included) grabbing for tissues.Other than that I can't wait to see the next movie. I think Tom is a great Spiderman, though all 3 of the actors are the best Spiderman, there simply isn't one who is better than the other. They all portrayed the character in amazing but different ways and it's lovely to see them together to notice their impact.Furthermore, all performances in this movie were great, I really can't think of any bad points in this movie.

It is great too see again some old villains and in general there is a lot of fan service but is done well and it's not annoying. The movie is also able to trigger people reactions and if you watch this movie in a passionate theatre the experience will be great because you can hear the sounds of the people around you, and it was something that I didn't experience since the pandemic has started and it was nice. You'll probably walk out from the viewing with very positive vibes and with high levels of satisfaction. BUT if you start think about it with a more critical view the magic will vanish because nothing makes sense. The premise is so stupid and the movie happens because Peter had suddenly become retarded, and not only him. Things happen because we will never know (like the reason for the return of the villains, the movie tries to give an explanation but in reality doesn't). And realistically what is the probability that between an infinite number of universes could happen exactly what has happened in the movie? How fortunate we were! And also the finale (that is very very satisfying and emotional) comes from a sudden change of the rules established previously in the movie. And so you can see that everything is only a pretext to please fans but without a real structure or a good premise behind it. The plot is useful only for the fan service. And if on one hand it is what has made my watching an experience, it is something that has to be noted. And so I am divided between my fan nature that has liked this movie and my rational and objective nature that dislikes it because of the nonsense of the plot. And so in conclusion what I can say is: go watch it for the experience without expecting a good movie, only a collection of cool scenes.\", 'Empty, empty, empty. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

Okay so I bought 4DX tickets and it was my first time, it\\'s crazy man. The seat started moving around like a roller coaster, wind was blowing, when the scene was somewhere cold in the movie the cinema got cold all of a sudden, water was being sprinkled everywhere, chair was vibrating and moving all over my back. The wind and water was coming from different directions, hit me behind my ears, in my face from the from the seat infront, from the sides, under and behind my ankles. I expected it, but was still really stunned. And I got a large Pepsi which I finished in about 20min and didn\\'t pee before the movie, which is 3hr long if you consider the cinema ads in the beginning, so halfway through I had to pee really bad and the seat was throwing me around, my bladder hurt so bad😂 didn\\'t want to miss a thing so I had to wait for the movie to end and people were staring at me all weird \\'cause I was the only one leaving since we all wait for the post credit scenes😂 there are two of them.But my outtake from the movie, what stood out the most to me is Tom Halland is really good at playing sad scenes, every time I see him sad or crying I feel like I wanna cry too, the African in me doesn\\'t allow it but I do. That Andrew Garfield scene also made me wanna cry. Spider-Man\\'s not one of my favorite heroes but I think this is one of the best movies marvel has made so far, and I love how each of the Spider-Mans all brought back the same feeling their individual movies had back then, it was great to see. Not really a complaint but I wasn\\'t really convinced Dr. Strange was that oblivious to the consequences of what he and Spider-Man were doing, he accepted doing the favour way too easily and didn\\'t seem surprised when everything went haywire; and can\\'t really blame it on the acting because Cumberbatch is astounding so I\\'ll assume it\\'s a \"giving thanos the time stone\" kinda situation. Unlike some MCU movies, this one didn\\'t make the fan theories seem bonkers.The movie\\'s quite long and takes you through different emotions, I got happy, then sad, then surprised then sad again and I think good movies should do that. Recent trend in superhero movies is to make them more comedic and I love it but thought was getting a bit too far because I think movies like Let There Be Carnage should have been much darker and gory, with a higher rating like R 18 even with the funny bits, not to say the same about Spider-Man, but i think they got the comedy-drama-action blend perfectly here. I was honestly surprised it\\'s maintaining a 9/10 rating even after being released a couple days but it is as good as they say.', 'I will do this kind of quick\\n1st act - 10/102nd act - fine little bit pulled the movie for the ground but the action was spectacular 8/103rd act - 10/10 felt like endgame for me , payoff al the wayStay until the post credit scenes , the second blew me away !!!

The first 40 mins drag... it\\'s badly scripted and paced, and can only appeal to children with short attention spans. The acting by the main stars (Even Benedict, yes) is below par and lines delivered with the enthusiasm of an audit.But seriously, it does seem that Marvel can\\'t make a stand-alone Spiderman movie without giving him other superheroes to help him out with the plot. He\\'s a weak hero - there, i said it. His range is minimal and his \"teenage problems\" are fast becoming dated and irrelevant. Marvel are in decline and it\\'s looking like they went \"too hard, too early\", with the Avengers.Ultimately, this is a kids\\' movie. Fans of Spiderman and Marvel will rush to defend this film, but make no mistake: this was a poor outing by Marvel. If you want to compare recent comic book hero movies then look no further than The Batman, then step back, take a deep breath and realise how bad this film is.', \"With Tobey and Andrew, is that all Tom Holland can show?

In the last two movies that Holland did as spider man, I was slightly disappointed because we only got to see a child who was constantly babied by Tony Stark. The Spider-Man who we watched in Homecoming and Far From Home hadn't really earned his place in my heart, with Holland's childish charm being over used and making the character of Peter Parker a boy who frankly doesn't live up to the standard set by his predecessors. In this movie however, not only did it give me a nerdgasm due to the fantastic ensemble cast, but I finally got to see Holland flex his acting muscles and show me whey he was cast in his role and why he has reached his levels of stardom.This movie was brilliant. The emotional themes which were laced into he movie kept the plot moving, with Holland, Willem Dafoe and Marissa Tomei showing us why they were truly hired. Unlike previous Spidey movies like TASM and Far From Home, this one truly captured my attention and boasted the elements of Spidey that I love so much.I will admit that when going into the movie, I was very hesitant about them bringing back the old Spider Men and villains, because I believed that they were better left untouched, but after watching the movie, all of my negative thoughts were blown away. Each villain gets their own time to shine, each of them harness their old selves whilst also elevating their characteristics.Toby and Andrew both come back, something which elicited screams of joy from everyone in the theatre. They were brilliant. Toby was calm but excited, mature but fun, wise but still held that social awkwardness that we all adored back in the day. Andrew in my opinion, was way better as Spidey in this movie than any of his own. There was a pure emotion behind Andrew's Spidey and we finally get to see why he was cast as Spidey. It worked. Having three socially awkward super powered nerds somehow worked.I won't lie when I say that this is by far my favourite Spidey movie of all time. There were so many tear jerker moments in the movie, with Tom Holland standing out in all of them. He finally showed me SPIDER-MAN in capital letters. His character's emotions were so believable due to the way in which he portrayed them. His character came across as human, as someone who makes mistakes and then seeks ways to fix it, in order to keep those who he loves safe.The classic uncle Ben line gets dropped multiple times in this movie, finally making this 'Home' trilogy as Holland's Spidey's origin story in a sense. We see how the famous Uncle Ben quote truly makes an impact on Peter at the end, making us cry with tears of sadness but also pride.My words cannot express how much I loved this movie. Especially that final scene.\", 'As I\\'ve said in some of my past reviews, some people only know two ratings, either a 1 or a 10.When every review, I see, is putting out a 10/10, perhaps one should step back and get some perspective. This isn\\'t The Godfather!If you\\'ve enjoyed Holland\\'s other outings, you will enjoy this.The trailer gives you clues as to what to expect AND I would strongly suggest you watch all previous Spider-Man films (the Sam Raimi versions and the \"amazing Spider-Man\" versions).It\\'ll help.First of, the film is certainly fun and funny. Lot\\'s of jokes and in jokes.There is some lag though. There is whole 10 minute scene in Happy\\'s apartment that plods a little but then we\\'re back to it.I think of all the previous Spider-Man relationships, Hollands and Zendya\\'s is the most believable (well that may well be as they are a couple in real life).The film is sort of like a sweet nostalgia trip.There are a few questions, we as the audience needed answering and which are even asked in the film, but the answers are never given. Despite that, it does a very good job of resolving a lot and putting to bed a number of issues from past films.I have said nothing of the plot nor do I intend to.The reason you are reading this review is either you want to understand why I didn\\'t give it a 10/10 and therefore why am I not fanboying over it or you genuinely want to know whether it\\'s worth seeing in the cinema.The answer to the first question is that it\\'s a very good film but it won\\'t make my top 10 of all time. There is a lot thrown at this and a lot of it sticks but some of it doesn\\'t quite hit the mark.The answer to the second question is well it depends on the cinema.My advise is that you go see it a big screen, good seating, social distanced cinema. You want that cinematic experience.I went to an multiplex with people sitting next to each other in a reasonably packed theatre with a screen which, frankly by today\\'s standard, was bog standard to small (which surprised me considering the calibre of film being shown),So yeah, go see it (especially if you\\'ve seen all the previous ones) but on a grand big old screen cinema with comfortable seating.Enjoy.', 'Spider-Man: No Way Home was a movie. It was a reason to get out of the house, especially considering all the buzz around it. It\\'s the first really massive blockbuster movie to come out in years. After seeing the reviews here (8.8/10) I was expecting a cinematic masterpiece. An action movie with excellent pace, depth, story. A movie you were so immersed in you never wanted it to end, and the whole movie flies by. Dark Knight Rises kind of level. It wasn\\'t any of those. It was just a movie.The whole movie begins under the premise of a magical spell cast by Dr. Strange to make the world forget Spiderman\\'s identity, a spell that goes horribly wrong. How did it go wrong, what\\'s the set-up for this entire movie? Spider-Man keeps interrupting Dr. Strange while he\\'s casting his spell. That\\'s the set-up for the entire movie. He keeps asking to add one more person to the exempt \"don\\'t forget me\" list, which Dr. Strange inexplicably keeps abiding to while scolding Spider-Man for interrupting. After Spider-Man asks for \"but wait I don\\'t want X to forget me either!\" for the 4th time, the spell goes awry and now the universe is broken. Now the movie can begin.Fast forward to the first villain to break into this universe, Dr. Octavius. He appears while Spider-Man is stalking someone who works at MIT in traffic to plead his case to get his friends into college. After a typical fight scene, Dr. O throws the car containing the college advisor off a bridge which Spider-Man eventually rescues. The advisor then walks by Dr. O, giving him a finger wag and a \"that was NOT cool!\" before apparently walking the remaining way to the airport. Just absolutely sucked whatever immersion I had from the fight scene out of me.The Villains make no sense. There\\'s like 6 of them, the main bad guy being Green Goblin. He goes nuts and kills May and flies off about halfway through the movie. After that he\\'s just gone until the last 15 minutes of the movie where he flies back for the Spider-Men to kill him so the movie can end. There\\'s nothing cool, special, or harrowing about this sequence. As for the other Villains, there\\'s no real clear understanding on what their motivations are other than to live. Which Spider-Man intends on allowing anyway.There\\'s a lot of other thoughts in-between I could touch on, but the above alone is enough to point at and say that this movie was far from great. If you haven\\'t seen every Spider-Man movie you wont even get the references, which I\\'m assuming is why this is currently so highly rated. The movie wasn\\'t funny AND lacked immersion. Kind of like a PG-13 Deadpool without humor. The plot was contrived and there was hardly any purpose for it. Parts were visually \"cool\" enough to make you stop thinking about something else momentarily.I think that the pandemic has really lowered everyone\\'s standards of what a good movie is, because this was not one.', \"Way to go marvel?

Spider-Man (Tom Holland) had been framed by Mysterio who also revealed his true identity, Peter Parker. He and his friends, MJ (Zendaya) and Ned (Jacob Batalon), are hounded by the media, demonized by many, and investigated by the authorities. Frustrated with his situation, he asks Doctor Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) to do a spell.This Spider group is a fun group. I love this young group and then there are the veterans. It's a great way to reincorporate the previous Spider-verses and the bonus is getting all these great veteran actors. They are all great at delivering complex characters. There is a bit of redemption for some who ended the previous versions on a down note. This is a good movie by itself as well as a good progression for the MCU.\", 'My Review - Spider-Man : No Way Home\\nMy Rating 8/ 10I\\'ve never seen a queue like this one at our local regional Blue Mountains Cinema so it looks like this new Spider-Man movie will be a Box Office bonanza . It certainly needs to be as the estimated Production Budget was an obscene $200 million USDollars .I rated the previous Spider-Man: Far From Home a very respectable 8/10 as I enjoyed it immensely.This movie is the sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017) and Spider-Man: Far From Home (2019), and is the 27th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe\\nSpider-Man: No Way Home (2021) takes place directly after the events of Spider-Man: Far from Home (2019). Meaning that it takes place in the Spring/Fall of 2024.With Spider-Man\\'s identity now revealed, Peter asks Doctor Strange for help. When a spell goes wrong, dangerous foes from other worlds start to appear, forcing Peter to discover what it truly means to be Spider-Man.The ingredient I enjoy most in this Marvel franchise and there\\'s a lot of comic book humour in Spider-Man or as I think this one should really be titled Spider-Men. No spoilers but I enjoyed the second half of this long movie more than the first especially when Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire form the formidable trio of Arachnids.It\\'s amazing to me where original quotes from Spider-Man show up and are used by other cultural iconic personalities I didn\\'t realise that Ru Paul\\'s often used quote \"With great power comes great responsibility, which Queen 👑 have you chosen to get the CHOPPED? Is a proverb popularized by the Spider-Man comic books written by Stan Lee and published by Marvel Comics\\nOf course the CGI effects are the best State of the Art but I think it\\'s the great ensemble cast that makes these films so entertaining including the Actor of the moment Benedict Cumberbatch as the Wizard Dr Stange . I particularly enjoyed Zendayer as Peter Parker\\'s girlfriend she has some great moments with Tom Holland (Spider-Man) and she\\'s delightfully natural.Tom Holland helped to save this movie from cancellation by forcing renegotiations between Sony and Disney. Under the terms of the new deal, not only does Spider-Man: No Way Home still take place within the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), but Spider-man can also appear in future MCU movies, as well as Sony\\'s own Spider-Man franchise.If Sci Fi Action is your favourite movie genre you\\'ll probably rate this latest Marvel movie higher than my quite high 8/10 Rating but I thought it a bit dull in parts and a tad too long 20minutes longer than Spider-Man : Far from Home which I enjoyed more and that movie only cost a mere $140 million estimated budget to make.Great Escapism Movie - Well done.', \"Bull..!

I didn't think the movie was bad, I found it a little confusing at times, but even so, I think it's a good movie, I don't think it's what people say about it, I don't think it's the best Spiderman movie. The narrative has its flaws, Peter Parker goes to ask a magician who is supposed to be responsible, to help him do something that can have huge consequences and the magician warns him, but still does what he wants, and i do think he as an adult should tell him he wasn't going to do that because it was too dangerous. The movie also surprised me positively, I love the part where all the spidermans come together, because as a spiderman fan I felt a lot of happiness to see all the spidermans come together to defeat all the villains.I can say then, that I found the movie a little overrated, but still a good movie.\", \"I had fun with this movie. The emotional parts get me, the story is interesting. However, there are some weak spots.The movie struggles with the mass of characters. The just disappear and enter stage again when they are needed for the plot. That isn't good writing. The characters make stupid decisions and decide things that seem like a mismatch with their personality, but have to happen so the story goes on. Some key moments are staged bad.

The problem with me and especially marvel movies is that I feel like i watch the same movie on and on with just some small changes of character. That isn't the problem with this movie, and i love how they have handled the multiversial topic which can often get out of hand and sometimes chaotic.

Which is a good thing as now we can enjoy spider-man as he was supposed to be, a lonely superhero, although he is helped by his friends but not by any other superheroes. I enjoy how the movie takes the necessary time to explore the relationship between Zendaya\\'s M. J and Tom\\'s Peter, I repeat, it only takes the time that is necessary, it doesn\\'t become a main thing in the plot but it does contribute to it. On the other side, Ned is hilarious and adds to the plot also what\\'s necessary for it to work in a proper way.I really enjoyed how the legal situation regarding spider-man\\'s identity was not an actual issue in the movie, but i feel glad we could see how that was handled as it worked as the main cliffhanger on the last movie. Talking about this, we had Daredevil\\'s cameo which I appreciate very much. On the other side, the trailer wanted to make it seem as if Stephen Strange didn\\'t actually care about doing a spell that could be tampering with time and space, in the movie he actually cares and proposes some other solutions for Peter, that in the end help him solve his problem.Something that I personally do not like about Tom Holland\\'s Spider-man is the fact that he is a little boy, they make everything that happens as his fault and I thought that was ok for the first movie, we could see character development and the impact between his relationship with Tony, however they repeated it in Far from home, which I guess it\\'s ok but this time I just ended up not liking him, well at least until the whole erased memory thing, after that I felt really empathic with him and his situation.Now can we talk about the 3 spider-mans??!?? Ofc this is something a lot of people thought about, something so big that when the rumor first came out it made absolutely everyone excited... This movie is symbolic, as Tom Holland states, this movie is the combination of three different generations that went to the movies to watch a spider-man movie. Something that I don\\'t believe has happened with any other superhero. Every one that was born between the 1980\\'s up to the late 2000\\'s has had this experience and now we all come together as one. In my personal experience, I grew up going to watch Andrew\\'s as a little kid and now that I am grown up and look back, I can not only see how much he has grown but also how I have grown since then, seeing Andrew and Tobey again in the big screen is something that I feel blessed about.Talking about the fan service, we can see the recreation of several memes; the \"I\\'m somewhat of a genius myself\" and the three spider-mans pointing at each other, also I know that we, the fans, would\\'ve been really happy if we only saw the characters fight against the villains but they actually gave us the extra; they working as a team and hanging out, just talking about the web shooters, which I know that we all thought about it but didn\\'t actually think it was going to be in the movie, also I completely loved the redemption of Andrew actually saving M. J. and all the nostalgia it means. And the answer to the questions \"How would Tobey and Andrew react to the idea of the avengers?\" Or \"How would Norman Osborn react to the fact that there is no Oscorp\". Regarding May\\'s death (which broke my heart) on the first 30 seconds I was kind of mad because they had killed her, however I believe that it was the greatest impact that we needed to finally focus on Peter as a potentially grown man, and ofc, this worked as a link to the other spider-mans, the \"leap of faith\" and I loved that they worked it in almost the exact same was as in \"into the spider-verse\" the \"we\\'re the only ones that know exactly how you feel\".The villains themselves were beautiful but the prize goes to Willem Dafoe, he nailed it yet again with the green goblin and made me hate him but also feel a bit of empathy towards him. In conclusion, I love the final evolution yet of Peter, we will now see him as a lonely spider-man with a really cool homemade suit and no Mr. Stark or aunt May to go to which, even if it sad, I believe its something that the character needed to reach the level of maturity, also, no avengers to turn to as they all forgot their memories with him. Basically if you read this even with the spoiler signs and haven\\'t seen it yet; make yourself a favor and go watch it, if you were a kid or a teen at the time any of the Spider-Man\\'s saga came out then just watch it, for old time\\'s sake... you\\'re literally being a part of a historic cinematographic event and the begging of a new era of blockbuster movies. Even if you don\\'t enjoy the story, marvel never fails at making visual masterpieces. So I give it a 10/10.

Even more than Endgame because I could see myself watching this movie again and there were less characters. I had no interest in watching Endgame again after it was released in the theaters two years ago. Spider-man: No Way Home was funny, sad, and delightful. The rumors are true: the Spider-men from the other movies were there, and they had great chemistry with each other. I hope I can see them together again.There were two parts that got me emotionally:\\n1) When Andrew Garfield\\'s Spider-man saves MJ. I remembered how Gwen Stacy\\'s death in the Amazing Spider-man 2 was a big deal in the franchise. When I saw the trailer for this movie with MJ falling, I thought \"Is MJ going to die? That\\'s be ballsy\". But she was gladly saved by none other than Garfield\\'s Spider-man, who didn\\'t want Tom Holland\\'s Spider-man to go though what he experienced. They all had their parent figures died (two Uncle Bens and an Aunt May). Garfield\\'s crying was the icing on the cake.2)The end. I liked that it ended dark, unlike other Marvel movies. Being the hero he was, Holland\\'s Spider-man decided to let Doctor Strange erase everyone\\'s memory of him because he didn\\'t want more mayhem. The Green Goblin killed Aunt May. I wanted him to ask out the memory-erased MJ at the coffee shop but I realized that he didn\\'t want history to repeat itself when he didn\\'t do it. Also, I was concerned about him not finishing high school when Peter decided to live alone. Then, it showed he was getting a GED. It put a smile on my face. Spider-man getting a GED, so it\\'s okay if you get one too.It was fun watching this with the fans at the theater during opening weekend. I was anxious at first about the noise. But these are people who really enjoy seeing their characters on the screen. I even got into it during a couple parts.After this movie\\'s box office success, there will be no excuses for studios.

From the first minute of the movie, it starts off strong, continuing immediately after the events of Far From Home. Cameos from Charlie Cox's Matt Murdock and Tom Hardy's Eddie Brock - Venom - only made the movie a more fun experience. The story Jon Watts told with this movie showed his incredible directing, with brilliant story-telling, and an even better cast. This movie really brought together three generations' worth of Spider-Man fans perfectly. I've watched the movie twice as of 19/12/2021, and I can't find a single flaw. It is without a doubt my favorite movie of all time, even topping The Dark Knight. The only problem I had with that movie was that the action seemed a bit forced, whereas in Spider-Man: No Way Home, the action is the best I've ever seen in a movie. I've never seen a theater scream and clap louder in celebration of a specific event happening in a movie, in this movie's case, the returns of Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire, who all played their roles perfectly. I loved how all three Spider-Men established their differences and had enough screen time for viewers to be satisfied with. Even the humor in this movie is on-point, from Zendaya's MJ, Jacob Batalon's Ned Leeds, Benedict Cumberbatch's Doctor Strange, to really everyone else in this movie, who all had the theater laughing. A lot of actors in this movie deserve awards for performances like these. Alfred Molina played Otto Octavius with as much consistency as we could have wished for, as if he had just played Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man 2 yesterday, one wouldn't think there was a 17-year wait in between. Jamie Foxx's Max Dillon really stole the show in almost every single scene that he featured in, truly redeeming Electro from that wasted performance in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. J. K. Simmons reprised his role as J. Jonah Jameson perfectly, showing his hate towards Spider-Man. You'd think Simmons was the real version of Jameson from how he knocked his role out of the park. Tom Holland, just wow. You can tell how much he's improved as an actor over the years. His acting is so good, you can hardly believe this was a fictional story - similar to Andrew Garfield and Tobey Maguire's acting in this movie. But most importantly, Willem Dafoe's performance in this movie was one of the best I've ever seen in my entire life - how he switched between playing a sad, old, and scared Norman Osborn, to playing a creepy, suspenseful, and evil mastermind in the Green Goblin, Dafoe absolutely crushed it and perfected the role. His acting was so good, it rivals Heath Ledger's Joker in my opinion, which for a long time, I believed to be the best cinematic performance of all time. Crazy to think its been 19 years since Dafoe last played Green Goblin, and he played it much better than he did in the original Spider-Man. According to my understanding of a few things I've read on the internet, Thomas Haden-Church and Rhys Ifans weren't available during filming and only had voice roles in this movie, and how the movie still continued to feature the Sandman and the Lizard without their actors is incredible, crazy to believe even the few seconds Flint Marko and Curt Connor's showed up in human form was re-used footage from Spider-Man 3 and The Amazing Spider-Man. In my opinion, the 15 seconds of swinging from all 3 Spider-Men just before the final battle to cure all the villains were the greatest 15 seconds in Marvel cinematic history. As a huge Spider-Man fan, I have been talking about this movie non-stop every single day to everyone I know for months, awaiting its release. Expectations were at an all-time high, unrealistically high, yet this movie still managed to EXCEED my exceptions. This movie consistently had me on the edge of my seat, even with its ending, which made me view its predecessors, Spider-Man: Homecoming and Spider-Man: Far From Home, differently. This trilogy truly encapsulated Spider-Man's origin perfectly, from having everything to having nothing - a true coming of age story. This movie was an emotional rollercoaster, from having me worried about what would happen next with Peter's identity reveal, relieved about the charges being dropped, excited with all the villain returns, sad and tearing up with Aunt May's death, on the edge of my seat with Tobey and Andrew's returns, tearing up in happiness with Andrew's redemption as he caught MJ, scared when seeing Tobey get stabbed, and then relieved with Tom's Spider-Man doing the right thing in the end, even though it meant Peter Parker had to lose in order for Spider-Man to win. Even the editing in this movie was fantastic, even for companies as big as Disney, Marvel, and Sony developing this movie together, the editing and CGI were consistently spectacular. I loved the new showcasing of Spider-sense, the battle against Dr. Strange in the Mirror Dimension, and every other scene of this movie that required editing. This is without a doubt a love letter to every Spider-Man fan, and the greatest movie I have ever watched, truly felt like an honor to have the privilege to see this in theaters. I 100% believe that this is not only the best Spider-Man movie of all time, not only the best Marvel movie, not only the best Comic Book movie, but THE greatest movie of all time.

One of the many positive things about this movie is that, you can tell the difference between this and the previous MCU Spidey Films is that this one has a lot more emotion to it, one of the problems i have with the first 2 movies is that, they feel emotionless and empty, sometimes bland but this one is full of emotions, which is what you need to make a good Spider-Man Story.Another Great thing about this movie is that it has character development, mostly for peter though. From the first 2 movies Tom Holland's spider man had always been happy, energetic and positive, and this one he's completely different because he just had understand what '' great power comes great responsibilities'' really mean.Aside from all the time, the visuals, the acting, the music is all perfect and beautiful and it's so great to see all the familiar faces we've seen in past Spider-Man movies come together and make this masterpiece.Overall This Movie is not perfect as a movie as a whole, but for Spider-Man fans like me it's literally everything you could've asked for, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a Spider-Man fan.\", 'There is no way this movie could have been made any better - i enjoyed it immensely!Until about the middle, it really felt like a classic coming of age movie and then everything basically flipped in a matter of seconds making thing very real, very quickly.

It didn't completely kill it for me just a bit overused and illogical. I give it 8/10.\", 'A great movie with some phenomenal acting from all the actors involved. Willem Dafoe as usual killed it as the Goblin. It was great to see him in this role. And all three Spider-Men were great. Tom Holland is maybe my favourite Spiderman after this movie. His acting is phenomenal and the character development that he goes through in this film has put him up in the contention with Toby in my eyes.I disliked him previously because he was a little immature, but maybe I was missing the point completely. Maybe it was like that by design, he had to face a tragic loss and I think in this universe his Uncle Ben doesn\\'t count as that big a loss as it does in other universes. He had to face a loss of someone he loved in order to grow and not just Tony but in this film as Aunt May dies with the all popular quote originally said by uncle Ben \"With great power, there comes a great responsibility.\" Tom Holland\\'s Peter Parker finally reaches that push into the mature life.It is a great character driven movie with a lot of high spots and cameos from different universes. But one of the things it lacked was that it couldn\\'t give justice to every character and story they were telling in the movie. I felt that the story didn\\'t get much time to breath and moved to fast. The villain suddenly became good because they are just \"cured\". Doc Ock\\'s character doesnt get much time after he was cured I felt it was too rushed. Doctor Strange felt to me a little out of character. I didn\\'t see him this irresponsible to cast out multiple spells just to entertain Peter\\'s request. I also didn\\'t like this superhero character trope of saving everyone. I think as a hero it is one of the best thing to realise that you cannot save everyone especially those who feel like they don\\'t need saving. I feel that is what Toby realizes in his first fight with Osborne as he fails to save the Goblin who had to die as a villain. And the last negative I will point out will be the cameos for the sake of cameos. Yes, I loved Toby and Andrew as Spider-Man and I jumped out of my seat seeing them in this universe in that uniform again. But at the end I just felt they didn\\'t have much to give in the larger story. And yeah you can argue that they helped Tom Holland\\'s character as he is going through a great loss of his Aunt May, and that\\'s fair. This movie definitely didn\\'t need these much villains I don\\'t think any villain get much time to breath except Goblin who was indeed the \"final boss\" of the movie.That being said I loved the growth Holland\\'s Spider-Man goes through in this movie and in the end I loved how he sew his own suit with classic red and blue colours symbolising the same. He is no longer a Spider-Man who relies on the high-tech suit. He can rely on his ability. As Stark had said to him \"If you are nothing without the suit, then you shouldn\\'t have it.\" And now he is finally something without the suit, he is the Spider man Toby and Andrew was. Loved it.Great acting. Great character development. Great fight scenes with all three spideys fighting side by side.', \"This is a very good superheroe movie.It's well written, it makes Tom Holland's Spiderman evolve and gives it a very good motive. It's also well implemented in the universe, may have some plot holes but, overall, it doesn't really matter.There's a lot of fanservice, but we wanted it, and also the humor may be a little bit annoying in some scenes.But, this is an incredible event and experience. Seeing all three Spidermans fighting together and interacting is something that I just can appreciate and be grateful for.This is a celebration of the Spiderman character and what it represents.\", 'If you are a 13 year old kid, this If you are a 13 year old kid, this movie is for you!

Growing up with the Tobey movies really set the bar for Spider-Man movies for me. Those movies defined what it is to be Spider-Man. A few years and a few Spider-Man movies later, that bar the Raimi movies had set remained untouched. The amazing Spider-Man movies were great in their own ways but suffered from some plot issues and an unfinished story. The previous MCU Spider-Man movies were also great in their own ways, but I always felt like they lacked real consequences and stakes. Nothing could hit that mark like the Raimi movies did... that is, until I watched this movie. The action, the light hearted humor, the emotions, the consequences, the responsibility... all of what defines Spider-Man, is all here. I think I can safely say that this movie is the best Spider-Man movie. As a huge Spider-Man fan, this movie was everything I wanted it to be and is an absolute game changer. I went in with ridiculously high expectations after imagining all the wild possibilities in my head before watching it. My expectations were exceeded and I could not be happier with what we got from this movie. It is the best Spider-Man movie.

The finale certainly dwindles but that isn't the biggest fault. The problem for me was with it's over-abundant fan service and the disingenous marketing surrounding the movie.I don't usually mark spoilers but it feels necessary here. It felt like this was supposed to be the film that got the multiverse started beyond the Loki series, and it truly doesn't. It is an entirely self-contained story. Even the venom tease from venom 2 post credits does not come to fruition, and instead, just passes through to another post credits scene to further tease.The film did have mostly positives across the board which kept it at an 8 for me. In particular, I think this is the best sound design in a Marvel film to date. The punches, terrain shattering, and dialgoue were so crisp and distinct. The sound scape just felt right in every scene and I would love Christopher Nolan to take some notes prior to directing his next thriller.\", \"Tom Holland's version of Peter Parker is still the most annoying of them all.

After watching it I felt sad, as if someone stole something from me. In this case all the buildup from two previous movies, character development, etc. One of the worst endings in a movie ever!The foundations of the film are weak - all happens due to a spell... how does the spell work actually? Why Strange did not talk it through with Peter before going to the basement and playing with magic??? He was supposed to be a genius, right? Why did the spell broke the way it broke, and why was it possible to repair it by making everyone forget who Peter is (not just Peter as Spiderman)? Like... whaaaat?Another thing, Peter is young, wants to to good and help people. He makes bad decisions, sure, but the movie tells you that wanting the help other will make your life misarable (first his friends and the spell happens, then the bad guys and May dies,then everyone... so spell happens again and everyone forgets) so just take care of yourself and do not mind anyone else.There were good scenes, the nostalgia of three Spiders was nice, some good humour too. But humour does not fit well to a movie wit such an ending. Make up your mind, what kind of movie are you making? Comedy? Drama?From a \"technical\" perspective this is a great movie. But from a script writing point of view it is a catastrophe. Marvel showed us that things that happened in previous movies had some order and sense (well, Endgame and time-travel was not so great) but here...

They only served as plain villains without depth. I very much disliked the concept that curing them is the solution and here\\'s why:Let\\'s start with Lizard: Though I didn\\'t really like the film he originated from (\"The Amazing Spider-Man\"), his actions were reasonable. You were able to understand his motives (in general: become a lizard to grow his missing arm) which drove him mad. In \"No Way Home\" he is useless, not interesting at all (because none of his original character arc is thematized) and completely unnecessary as he is not a real threat, just annoying! He can not be cured by taking away the lizard inside him because for him, it\\'s not a disease in the first place.So next one is Sandman: His criminal actions were also totally reasonable as he needed money for his sick daughter. While doing so, he accidentally shot Peter\\'s uncle Ben. In the end, Peter and him settled their conflict because it turns out Sandman is not a bad guy, just a desperate one. They ended up not being enemies anymore. So his character arc is perfectly completed in \"Spider-Man 3\". Thus there is absolutely no reason for him to return to \"No Way Home\" as a villain! I remember the heartbreaking scene when Sandman first tried to emerge from the sand after the transformation and needed several trials to rise and grab the necklace with a picture of his daughter inside... \"No Way Home\" completely destroys this character built in \"Spider-Man 3\". But the concept of curing would fit to Flint as he never wanted to become a Sandman in the first place. Still, he didn\\'t necessarily need a cure, as he reconciled with himself in \"Spider-Man 3\".Next up is Electro from \"the Amazing Spider-Man 2\": Max is one of the most tragic villains in Spider-Man movies so far. He is a brilliant man, but noone acknowledges him for anything. You could empathize with him and understand his anger. With his powers he could channel his rage and finally be seen by the world. Given the fact that in \"No Way Home\" he and the other villains were teleported to Tom Holland\\'s universe just before their death, let\\'s look at Electro in that blink of the moment: He was totally insane and about to become the biggest threat in Andrew\\'s universe. Once he arrived in Tom\\'s universe, he was a completely different person, rather sane and totally clear in mind. He was Jamie Foxx, not Electro. Real Electro would\\'ve never let anyone touch his powers.Ok let\\'s talk about Doc Ock from \"Spider-Man 2\". Great villain with a big dream gone wrong. His character arc is also perfectly completed in his original film. In the end, he even sacrifices himself after regaining control of his machine to prevent any more damage. In \"No Way Home\", he was rather presented as a joke to force laughs. Very sad. But at least in his case, the concept of curing works perfectly, as it is something technical and Otto of course never wanted to lose control.Last up is Green Goblin from \"Spider-Man\": In my opinion, this character stays true to his original personality. And he is the only one out of all the villains that was taken seriously in \"No Way Home\" as a threat that he is. But it is very questionable whether or not his psychosis can be cured by an injection?Anyway, the dynamics and dialogues all around and between the villains were all just jokes and patters. Big lack of depth.What I\\'m also not convinced of is the concept of wanting to always save everyone. It has always been the biggest motivation of any Spider-Man to try save everyone around him, even the villains. Thus, understanding that sometimes, it is simply not possible, is one of the hardest things to accept, but it gives you the strength to grow and make hard decisions. Tobey couldn\\'t save Norman Osborn, he grew so insane that he basically destroyed himself. Andrew had to kill Electro in order to save everyone else.What I did like very much was the concept of curing for our protagonist Peter Parker with the help of Tobey and Andrew. And please, Tobey is Spider-Man 1, Andrew is Spider-Man 2 and Tom is Spider-Man 3.Though I have to say that Tom\\'s naivity and childishness in the first half of the film really annoyed me as it seems like he hasn\\'t grown a bit in the last 2 films. At least since Mysterio (and let\\'s not forget what he experienced in Infinity War and Endgame) he should\\'ve become more responsible. Tobey found that out in his very first film and had to deal with it. Andrew reached that point in his second film and Tom needed a full load of 3 films to get to that point, which is somewhat exhausting to watch.Nevertheless, like I said, it is a very entertaining film and it has great and memorable moments!But I still ask myself one thing: I don\\'t know how exactly the spell works, but wouldn\\'t it have been possible to erase Mysterio and what he said from everyone\\'s mind instead?', \"Well well...

PERFECT.', \"Yes, that statement is really bold, thinking about the original 2 but I can firmly say that it is true, Spider-Man No Way Home is the best movie of the whole entire year, yes, even better than Zack Snyder's Justice League.I can't believe they actually did it.This film is the perfect culmination of everything leading up to this point, the performances are unforgettable, Molina and Holland give the best performances I've ever seen from them, they are unbelievable here.Dafoe is perfect, his performance is haunting.This film has the best action sequences since The Avengers, the direction was insane, mind-blowing really.But it's not just that, it takes risks, I will not spoil anything for you, but this movie touches all the heartstrings.Cumberbatch is incredible in this, even better than usual.Also, it is one of the funniest films Marvel has ever made, every line spoken fits perfectly.They did such an amazing job bringing everyone back, and the special effects were exquisite, as I've come to expect from Marvel.I loved every single second, it's a mind-blowing, exhilarating ride from start to finish, I will be seeing it again in theaters, 2 and a half hours never felt so short and entertaining, I didn't want it to stop.I'll just get what you know is coming out of the way, I'm gonna give Spider-Man No Way Home an A+.I will be remembering it for years.\", \"I've seen ever spider man movie and this one is the worst in my opinion.

Spiderman\\'s dive into the multiverse is beautiful on almost all fronts in both design and animation. Dazzling displays of light, color, flashing, and explosions are blended together to make exciting, comic book feeling moments, all while getting hit with darker layers as the fight progresses. Spiderman facing the various villains seen in the trailer are fantastic, as web slinging, dodging, and various blasting occurs to rock the screen with amazing, theater rumbling effects. It\\'s a very cinema worthy movie for this alone, but there is so much more to it.The Comedy:\\nDisney is all about cramming the jokes into the movie to lighten things up, and sometimes they take it too far. Fortunately, No Way Home manages to keep the comedy in check, timing things at the opportune moments and hitting running gags to keep us ingrained in the MCU Spiderverse. The banter was mostly kept in check, each of the characters styles blended well together with awesome chemistry, and even better it was not too much to trip up the emotional moments this movie has, which is a fantastic balance for this reviewer.The Action:\\nFor the most part, the fights and chases in this movie feel very much like something from the Marvel comic universe. Taking that classic Spiderman taunting, while implementing strategy, agility, and use of environment, led to some decent moments that were suspenseful and interesting to see what damage would be caused. As the movie\\'s tone changed, the nature of the fights changed too to keep pace, and by the end it was an amazing blend of comedic, action, and emotion to paint a near perfect finale for me.The Acting:\\nAgain, Marvel casted well in this movie and opens up so many great chemistry networks between the characters that were in this movie. Holland is still a wonderful blend of Peter Parker and Spiderman, who has taken the character again to further heights and pulls the character through the ringer. This movie puts the main character into the ringer and Holland does things so well to really grab that emotion and pull at your heart strings. Zendaya\\'s quality still shines through, and her rendition of M. J. still holds the same core foundation, but starts to further evolve and grow the seeds planted at the end of Far From Home. Cumberbatch as Dr. Strange is top notch as usual, he\\'s fun, he\\'s classy, and he really sets the stage for the future of the character in this bizarre multiverse being set up and is exciting to see this transition layering more onto the character. Jacob Betalon as Ned again rocks in the comedy moment, but also extends to some other moments that were again perfect for the story. Alfred Molena, reprises the role of Doc Oc super well, bringing the same narcissism intellect of the character, but diving back into the complexity of the character we had in the second movie. There are so many more to compliment, but I can\\'t due to potential for spoilers, but rest assure that the chemistry between this cast is a mixture of quality.Handling the Characters Well:\\nSpiderman: No Way Home had a lot of balls to juggle and for me, they did it quite well with the material they had to present. Extending the story from the end of the last movie, while mixing in Strange felt very natural, with adequate time spent listing out the problems and solutions the two \"Avengers\" had to find for the spell that went wrong. And once that door was opened, the complexity of the story required a lot more planning and direction. Watts and the team succeeded, managing to keep a lot of characters in the mix and making sure their inclusion was meaningful past the simple marketing for toys. Even the villains get some decent balance, again bringing their own interactions and plot components that for the most part were not forced or counteractive. It was a fantastic display of coordination and effort and given the potential disaster this could have been, I\\'m very much happy with the results.The Emotional Heart:\\nThese movies and characters mean the world to the fans, and that means crossing into the heartstring pulling territory. No Way Home hits this several times, and I loved the moral testing components that they wrote in here for so many characters. Diving deeper into these characters, we got past the simple good-guy vs. Bad-guy motif and instead got something much bigger that again justified the inclusion of so many things. This is certainly one of the clutch moments of the MCU and I dare say it was something that sets so much up for the rest of the wave.DISLIKES:Pacing at the beginning:\\nIt\\'s all about the set up and making sure we are ready for everything to happen in the movie. As such, that was the part of the movie that I found to be a little drawn out and boring at times for me. I don\\'t know if I was just tired, or I was hoping for a little more movement or suspense and it took about the first thirty minutes before the first fight really kicked in. Once that happened, the pacing issues were very minor at that point, only going a bit fast a few times in how some of the twists were brought in.The Computer work at times:\\nAs much as I enjoyed the special effects and CGI, I can\\'t say that it was flawless. No Way Home does have moments where the computer look reared its head and took shortcuts into the less realistic looking realm. The very artificial movements, the digital look to the skin, and a few other moments did drop into the lower resolution. Again, a minor flaw for me, but something I have seen in the past get fans upset.The Action at Times:\\nThere are times where the fighting really started to ramp up, finding a great pace and stride that was gearing up for a great Spiderman brawl. However, the action would then trip and lose that momentum with an abrupt ending. There were great moments where they achieved all those incredible fighting sequences, but there were times I would have liked a little more coordination and magic that we had with other films, especially at the end with the way they were solving some problems. It feels like they were running out of time and some cuts were made to offset the full coordination, but again this is still a nitpick moment for picking on to find the answer.Some of the Bad Guys Needed A Little More:\\nDoc Oc as I said earlier was a fantastic villain they did so much with and Green Goblin as well has the bite that feels like an extension of the classic character. However, the Lizard and Sandman (which have been seen in the trailers), felt a little more time was needed to further expand upon their characters more and give them the same bite they held long ago. I know the reasons they were brought in for the most part, but... there still could have been some more fun with them to help get a little more mojo and time with them would have been amazing.Predictable:\\nI got most of the twists they were trying to surprise us with. Lots of foreshadowing handed you the keys to getting the big events that were going to happen and how they were going to help repair the mess they were looking. I can\\'t say that the call of things being a surprise were really a surprise. However, this minor dislike still does not take away from the enjoyment of the movie for me.The VERDICT:\\nSpiderman No Way Home achieved a lot of greatness for this reviewer and makes me feel a little more comfortable from what is coming out of Marvel in the future. It\\'s a fun movie that has so much to it and really brings forth an amazing experience meant for viewing in the theater. It\\'s exciting, it\\'s got heart, it\\'s got comedy, and it keeps many things in the air with a balanced manner that was certainly exceeding the expectations that I had going in. No Way Home shows the multiverse may be in good hands and if they can continue this art of balance of new ideas and foundations, then we are in good hands. Sure, there are some pacing issues at time, some simplified solution finding, and a few characters needing a little more time. However, overall, this film is in the top Spiderman movies and I strongly encourage you to see it in the theater if you can find the time.My scores are:Action/Adventure/Fantasy: 9.0\\nMovie Overall: 8.0-8.5.', \"A shallow movie with repelling CGI.

On other hand, Tom taught us that with great powers comes great responsibility, and we should never seek revenge and do the right thing.

This movie could have easily clocked in at two hours and feel like the perfect blockbuster movie. But no. After the finale, the \"good byes\" stretch on and on. Then of course there is baiting for other upcoming MCU movies. Even the fun jokey jokey scenes that are the hallmark of this franchise get cringe-worthy sometimes. I still give this movie a thumbs up, because it took a concept and found some fun with it. There is a little bit of manipulation, with more than a few tear jerker scenes (really? How many times do you need to push the waterworks?). But the biggest thing this movie has going for it is re-thinking the villains. Instead of the villains arriving and being bad guys, we find a way to make them sympathetic, and the audience will go along with the alternate storyline.I also like Benedict Cumberbatch. He fares well as a secondary character that only appears in the movie every once in a while. At the heart of the success of this current iteration of the Spiderman franchise is the friendship, particularly MJ and Ned. They stay integral to the center of the story quite intentionally, so you feel this is more of an ensemble piece that the previous two movies. However, the expected fan service (rumors are true) takes over and becomes the twist in the story. The concept of multiple universes has been pushed by Marvel for the last couple years, and here it is used as a vehicle for conflicts that arise.So I enjoyed the story, the treatment of the villains, plus the high buck action scenes we expect, and the supporting characters. For that reason, I will declare this film is the best of the three. Just get ready for some tugs at the heart in the third act, where you may find yourself getting a little annoyed that another music cue (the solitary piano notes with the sad violin) is making you well up again.I will give this a 7 out of 10, despite the extra half-hour of hugging.', \"This movie is a shame to cinema.It is ridiculous, not funny when it's suppose to be, and the action is just a bomb without explosion.

While weird it somehow worked just about & the story wasn't too bad either!However, the film is 2hrs & 15mins too long! It drags there's scenes which are too dumb to be in the film which take away from the seriousness! While I liked the return of the original Spider-Mans it felt dumb & weird to some extend & that it wasn't its own film, like with the previous 2 films...!Overall, it's a good film to an extent, but it's not amazing! 6/10!\", 'Please stop celebrating mediocrity.

I liked the acting, the little gems, the sheer hubris of the story. However, it was for all intents and purposes, a universe consolidation move (before they break it all again in Multiverse of Madness). It\\'s one of those reset stories, but one that manages to unite previous resets, which makes it the resettiest of them all. It is there to basically answer all the comic geek questions about how could so many films and reboots and stories exist in the same MCU and open the door to the future.There were no real new characters, some were explained away, some where killed off and new concepts of the incoming threats hinted at. One end-credits scene winked towards a Venom recrossing, while the second was basically a trailer for the next Doctor Strange film, not a \"scene\".So there is a difference between the typical Marvel cinematic universe film and this one: the villain(s) are weak and unfocused while the plot, however entertaining, just a background to the goal of the film: to stabilize the canon and prepare for the new Doctor Strange movie. This does mean the Strangeverse will grow and possibly be amazingly fun, but also that I don\\'t see the Avengers going anywhere for a long while, except maybe TV series.In conclusion: for the fans of the Marvel stories and the faithful viewers of movies and series in that universe, this is a big nice bonus, a step on a promising ladder of new content. However as a standalone film it has limited value. It is a good film, and probably a necessary one, but its storytelling will not blow your mind in any way.', 'It was certainly one of the most anticipated films of Marvel and probably of the MCU, but despite to enchant, entertain and fill hearts on one hand, on the other hand it is enough, analyzing objectively, to understand that there is a lot of wasted potential, little substance and a sense of pure emptiness. Sore points like the very poor CGI in some scenes, the profaning of the sacred, the obviousness of the story and the lack of intelligence of the primary and secondary characters; but this last flaw is not exactly appropriate in a world like the Spider-Man\\'s one (veterans know it well), although this is an alternative and a \"light\" version of our friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. Despite everything it disappoints and fascinates at the same moment, but unfortunately this is typical of the MCU, which tends more to the comic than the serious, which tends more to the fast than to be dynamic, which is not necessarily a flaw, but still leaves something to be filled and it definitely annoys sometimes. The main problem lies in ridiculing the characters underneath their strongest traits, in making shapeless what was once epic, in marginalizing what was once poetic, so sadly it fails miserably in this. However, in the end, the film does not disappoint in expectations and hopes, so it fills hearts, entertains, enchants and above all charges the future with further expectations and among other things showing us a much more mature and constantly growing Spider-Man (all accompanied by an excellent cast). In conclusion, but with a cold and objective mind (what everyone should adopt at the end of the screening): it is beautiful, but not too much, could it have been done better and more? A lot, really a lot, but let\\'s say we like it, but not that much.', \"Another cookie cutter film by Marvel with nothing truly special expect the fanfare given by recasting old actors.It's competent but honestly felt like a waste of time, would only recommend it if you're a marvel/spiderman fan.\\n                \\n                    16 out of 34 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

It was good to see Andrew Garfield as he was my second favourite Spiderman who was more of a funny Spiderman that makes jokes he should have had one more film. I grew up watching my main Spiderman the one and only Toby Maguire who to me is the best Spiderman aka Peter Parker.This really, is truly a a great Spiderman films for all Spiderman fans of all three generations. Just amazing.Also what I love is the detail of each of the spider mans. We get to see how Andrew Garfield Spiderman is doing with the death of his girlfriend and how it has made an impact on him and we get to see how mature Tobey Maguire Spiderman has become over the years and was the one to help, get to Tom holland Spiderman. You can see the differences of all three spidermans.\", '\"Where do we go from here?\" is the biggest question I have after leaving the cinema. The possibilities are endless both for Spiderman and the MCU as a whole.Firstly, this movie absolutely delivers on so many levels. So often, the hype for a film could leave you disappointed but not this one. Fan service is at the very core of No Way Home but at the same time it ties in beautifully to what we\\'re seeing with this new phase of MCU projects.With all the craziness, epic moments, secrets and reveals, I was worried this movie will take the attention away from Tom Holland\\'s Spiderman but if anything it just adds to his story arch and sets up an amazing potential future for the character. I honestly can\\'t wait to see what comes next for Spiderman and Peter Parker. Holland does a fantastic job and we really get to see just how good of an actor he is in this movie. No Way Home is filled with fantastic visuals and plenty of emotion, and in classic MCU style, thrilling action, your usual one liners and (not always, but definitely in this film) a storyline that keeps the Marvel steam train running at full force.There are many scenes in this film that will leave long time Spidey fans feeling like a kid again and is exactly what you\\'d expect it to be. The feeling of joy, nostalgia, excitement and to some extent, relief, was truly magical and I\\'m forever grateful to have experienced it. It would be extremely difficult to ever witness something like this on the big screen again. Thank you Marvel, and thank you Sony.In my opinion, there are some areas in the film \\'s storyline where it suffers a bit. Some of the character\\'s decisions are a bit Strange (no pun intended) in parts with certain events being questionable. But then again, that\\'s the tricky part with these films. It\\'s science fiction and you can never read too much into the details. Sometimes its best to just accept it for what it is, which in this case, is an epic superhero adventure.Despite the VERY minor questionable plot details, No Way Home is undoubtedly a phenomenal film that will go down as one of the greatest superhero films of all time. It is a true love letter to Spiderman fans and an event that will surely open up a multitude of possibilities for the MCU.', \"Simple plot, normal action, not gonna big surprised at the ending, not very creative of directing style.

The entry, the beginning was one of the worst I seen in an movie for longest time.The attempt to build up the atmosphere was forceful and draggy, to a point It was itching to forward the entire interlude.And the speed the plot built to a point where it managed to somewhat finally shape into something solid was agonizing.I won't talk about CGI effects or action scenes, that's defacto for MU movies and starting to think, the whole sale point lately.But good lord was the core of plot messy, dull and uninspiring piece of work. Who writes this scripts?The only reason why this is not lower is the ace they pulled and brought into the movie some redemption in form of what all previous movies have done better... And with it some essence.But even that was spoiled with blamesy of stupid jokes. Seriously, if you are going to continue this, you need to change the way you crack jokes and stop doing it in every single situation with exception where you remove permanently someone from MU movie universe.Essentially this was clumsy done hard reboot to change what they done in previous movies and stir more towards the Amazing Spiderman...I am really disappointed with execution and bewildered at positive reactions to this movie, when this would be butchering at the scale of what Hobbit movies have done to source material...\", \"The first 2 MCU Spider Man's were okay but No Way Home is easily the greatest outing yet.

Bringing back actors from previous Spider-Man movies in the way they did! It's a miracle!(I managed to stay away from all the trailers and speculation. Now that I finally watched the trailer .... they show the whole movie in it, don't they?)So why the 7 stars? Because as much as I love all the fanservice (even if quite well done and I don't say it in a derogatory manner ), there are stll storytelling flaws - mainly with the morality aspect of the story.When Aunt May asks Peter to keep the villains here, she had only met Osborn who was freaking out about being in a new universe where nothing familiar to him (including himself) exists. And her idea of helping was to keep him here? That sounds like kidnapping! That sounds more like wanting to 'help' him herself so she can feel like a good person, rather than doing what's right for Osborn. Not saying May is that kind of person, but the writing makes it look odd atleast to me. She didn't even know about the villains dying if they returned. Besides, aren't they still going to die when they are sent back to the moment of their death despite Peter 'curing' them? If that's not so, the movie doesn't explain how.Essentially, I felt they tried to make a trolley-problem out of this when in this case the people on one of the tracks are already dead. All of this makes both Spider-Man and Dr Strange look extremely irresponsible (although not in the way the movie acknowledges) . Maybe whatever's going on with Strange that made him quite as cavalier as he was with the spell, not even discussing the parameters of it with Peter before casting it, will be explained in the Dr Strange movie. If not, it's simply out of character and feels like a contrived problem to get so many characters into the movie.Coming back to how they tried to make a trolley-problem out of this, I simply feel what Peter did was wrong - trying to 'save' the villains who were already dead (and I guess WILL die anyway once they return) and putting the entire multiverse at risk on top of risking so many more people getting pulled into the mess.\", \"This is not only the best Spider-Man / marvel movie I have seen so far, it's also the best movie ever!

There were high expectations for this movie, and after careful thought, I am not satisfied with how it turned out.As trailers were being released, I only watched the first one because I did not want to risk seeing too much considering the Sinister Six was hinted at (except for the mystery sixth member). But that was pivoted to essentially every villain for himself situation for majority of the movie and made for a loose story.The story did not hit home for me. Spider-Man was essentially trying to save the villains from themselves by curing them. The cure essentially would take all their powers away and all that would be left is just a human. To me, this made Spider-Man the antagonist.There was one part of the movie that I truly enjoyed and that was when Doc Ock first appeared on the bridge (also shown in the trailer). That entire sequence was edge of your seat worthy. But then as the movie progressed, it became too predictable which took away from the edge of your seat feel.One thing that really bothers me about the Tom Holland Spider-Man movies is his web swinging in New York. We have yet to really see that happen despite this is his sixth appearance on the big screen. That is one of the most exciting parts of Spider-Man is seeing his web swinging throughout New York City, and the audience finally got it but only for approximately 15 seconds.Sony and Marvel should have done a better job with producing a story which showed the Sinister Six instead of their tactic of bait and switch.', \"This one was exactly like how I expected it to be.

The earlier tales, especially the first, worked because they felt like simpler teen movies and the main characters - Peter, Ned, MJ - had fantastic chemistry.

I expected a good but not great movie, plot wise, with incredible action scenes and CGI- the usual Marvel experience. However, I was wildly disappointed.PETER PARKER(Tom Holland)- is a horrible protagonist. He might as well be the antagonist since all he does is screw up. He makes Dr. Strange fudge up his spell, then attacks him when he tries to help him correct his mistakes. He keeps spouting about 'morality'and 'saving everyone' yet he tries to kill Goblin (which he knows is mentally deranged) as revenge for aunt May. He makes stupid decisions throughout the whole movie, like letting out the villains when he could've just worked out a solution while they were in confine. This decision ultimately leads to aunt May's death.ZENDAYA- was not a good part of the film. She constantly felt snobbish and added little to no value to the movie. Every scene with her felt stale.AUNT MAY- sucked. I hated aunt May. Her whole shtick of 'let's heal them' is incredibly moronic because 1)those are lethal hostile people who have shown no intention for reform themselves and 2) they need to be sent back to their universe because saving a few people in front of you is more important than saving the multiverse. This philosophy leads to ending where Peter gets punished for this by being erased from everyone's memories, essentially losing his life.SANDMAN- did not need to be saved. I do not understand what the hell they did with him. Why did he fight Spiderman in the final combat scene?? He holds the same interests as Peter and the others to go back to his universe. If he should be fighting anybody, it's Electro who has the opposite intent. This part made absolutely no sense to me.LIZARD MAN- cannot be saved. He is a scientist looking to make everyone a lizard as well. Why does turning him to a human 'save him'? Won't he just make himself lizard again and continue with his agenda? They did not address this at all.GREEN GOBLIN- was pretty cool. I liked Goblin in the movie, I guess he was the cliché villain which tries to make the hero question his path but whatever. However, why didn't they keep him in confinement if he himself knew about his 'goblin' personality. If he truly wanted to do no harm wouldn't he just remain in the magic prison until his personality disorder can be fixed?BUGLE NEWS- was one of my favourite things in this movie. Through it they were able to criticize bombastic TV personas like Alex Jones, but if you listened closely to what he said you could agree with some of the things he says. At the end of the movie, after he forgets Spiderman's Identity, he demands that Spiderman shows his true Identity because only a coward hides his identity. I agree with this. Especially with law personnel, you want transparency. The whole idea of an unknown vigilante striking 'criminals' without any accountability would be very unsettling in our world, especially with the controversy today surrounding police brutality.ANDREW GARFIELD- was great. I loved him in this movie. He was likeable, empathetic and responsible. He was the best Spiderman in this movie, by far. The scene when he got closure by saving Zendaya was great.THE FIRST HALF OF THE FILM- was very boring. There was almost nothing interesting going on. I could've eaten dinner during the start, come back to the movie around the halfway point and not miss much.I would not recommend watching the film.

I used to go to the movies all the time, but due to the whole pandemic thing I have not gone in a long while and add to that crippling depression making going out for me a very difficult task. That being said, I am a huge Spider-man fan and I have seen all the Spider-man films in the theater so I managed to get out of the house for my off day from work rather than just staying in bed all day. I was rewarded with a very good film, full of action and nostalgia; however, that being said due to my state of mind it also made me severely sad and a bit suicidal. Just hard for me these days to fully enjoy anything with me growing older and life becoming a pointless endeavor. Still, I enjoyed seeing the old villains, especially Dr. Octopus as he is my favorite Spider-man villain from the comics.The story, Mysterio's message at the end of Far From Home has Peter hounded by the press, taken in by agents and ruins his and his friends MJ and Ned's chances of getting into MIT. So Spider-man goes to Dr. Strange's place where he asks if there is anything the good sorcerer can do. Dr. Strange says he can make everyone forget Spidey's identity, but while in the middle of casting, Spider-man keeps adding stipulations causing the spell to go out of control. Soon enemies of Spider-man from the multiverse emerge and Spider-man must round them up so that they can be sent back; however, our hero soon learns that they are going to die and he wishes to help him despite Dr. Strange's protests. Soon Spider-man finds himself in the need of help as things get there darkest and he finds two other allies to help set things on the correct course.The film is good, but it definitely did not help my depression one bit. Watching the scene where MJ was rescued almost had me burst into tears, as I remembered the scene from one of the other films and remembered my fiance who has since passed away was with me during this time. I also felt alone as Peter was and feel a sense of hopelessness as my life has no meaning, so while a good movie, it probably can hurt someone who is struggling with bad depression as I am. I was honestly hoping for a more happy type film to make me feel a bit cheered up more than one that made me go further down...So a great film, one of the better MCU films and my favorite of Tom Holland's Spider-man films. I honestly, though, would love to see Garfield return to the role for maybe another Amazing film as it was good seeing him as Spider-man again and it would be nice to see some closure for his Spider-man. Heck, I would not mind another Tobey one either as that series never did have full closure either! That one is probably less likely due to Tobey's age though. I will say my only real complaint of the film is the lack of a new villain, this being due to the fact Spider-man has a whole gallery of villains so having a new one would have been easy and would have given the film six Spidey foes making them sort of a Sinister Six! That would have been cool, but still an amazing film all the same.\", \"This movie is absolute masterpiece in the term of CGI. But that's all. Other than that, everything is poor and really disappointing even for Marvel standards. It has very poor story telling terrible directing and poor story.

I was as excited as anyone to see exactly what they were going to do with the endless possibilities of the film\\'s premise, but I came out of the cinema feeling conned by what I saw as a shameless cash grab by marvel. Almost nothing in this film\\'s already lazily thrown together plot made sense; for instance we were told by dr strange that \"everyone who knows Peter Parker is spiderman\" came through the multiverse. Firstly, why...? The film didn\\'t bother to explain this any further, just offering the justification of \"because magic/ the multiverse\". Secondly, several of the villains that came through didn\\'t even know Peter Parker was Spiderman, as Jamie Foxx\\'s character even admits at the end of the film. But nothing that happened over the course of the exasperating couple of hours of runtime mattered anyway because Dr Strange just did a magic spell to reverse everything. The filmmakers seemed to just think that viewers would blindly accept or just wouldn\\'t notice these gaping plot holes, which is a huge insult to our intelligence. But based on the reception this film got, it seems that marvel correctly estimated the intelligence of the majority of their viewership, expecting the appearance of several beloved characters from previous franchises to send them into such a giddy state that they thought this film was good. And full credit to marvel, it worked. If this kind of lazy writing punctuated by ridiculous meme-bait and popcorn moments is the future of cinema then I think it would have been best if the pandemic had spelled the end for cinema as we know it.', \"The plot is very important when making a movie but this plot fails.

The humor is the worst part of this film, and it's so cringe and forced, especially when they subjugate the Maguire and Garfield villains to it. Then they throw Maguire and Garfield into the mix to, which makes it even worse.There's more stakes in this film which is good, but by now I just don't care, since the last two films have been so safe and snuggly that I've felt nothing for the entire journey. They use Doctor strange well however, and since some of this film happened in the comics they deserve some credit for pulling it off. But most of the movies premise is weak, and it's battles are all dull and anti climatic, especially the final one.MJ and Ned are once again a nuisance, and they continue to make me miss the days of the real Mary Jane Watson, as well as Harry and Gwen. This Aunt May hasn't improved either, but you can't improve a character that will always look like a model instead of an Aunt.\", \"I was afraid that NWH would also be as bad as Spiderman 3 or TASM 2 with so many characters being involved.

So, yeah, no hater but a huge fan and a crazy lover. Even when everyone was talking s**t about the Amazing Spider-Man,I'm the one of some to defend its reputation (pretty young and some dumb shit to do). Even, to be totally honest, when everyone thought the relationship between Pete and Tony was freaking weird,I found that s**t interesting.But when they gave me this and expected me to write a bluff piece about how awesome it is, I had second thoughts. Was this movie that awesome? Was this movie good? Was this movie even OK? Suddenly I don't know the answer to each question. After a while when the digital version of it came out, I paid 20 DOLLARS for it with no hesitation.And I just wanna strangle myself the minute I finished rewatching it.Don't get me wrong , it can't be that bad. It surely has several highlights that deserve to be praised and remembered. The return of Willem Dafoe as Green Goblin, Alfred Molina as Doc Octopus and Tobey and Andrew as Spider-Men was nothing short of a miracle. Being able to see them again after all these years of separation, we, to see those familiar faces from our early days (my childhood to be exact)again, all witnessed the history and I couldn't feel more honored.And that was it, the one and the only exciting point. Now let's get down to some parts which I think was not enough and definitely not impress me.First, it's been six movies since we saw the Tom Holland's Spider-Man and god he hasn't grow at all, literally at all. Since Ben is missing, so we automatically put Tony into the spot of Peter's father-like and mentor-like role. After Tony died, we all expected him to take a look at himself of the responsibility he should've taken and what a true hero means to him and his life and his family and his beloved ones, but he didn't. Alright he's young, he needs time no worries. After his first real fight with Mysterio without Tony being around him, he was supposed to take the responsibility as a hero but not a kid. We didn't see it, fine he's just a kid ok we get it. But after Mysterio revealed his identity, what popped right into his head? Let Strange cast a spell so everyone could just forget about it. I mean,what kinda hero is he if he didn't stand up to face this drought and just wanna run away from it.Secondly, I understand that the filmmakers want to give him a push to grow up so they literally kill aunt May by using Peter's own hands. I get it alright, I get it. But why in the hell he wanted to save those so-called villains? They've destroyed thousands of innocent families, all those innocent ones. The minute Spider-Man decided to save them, to give them a second chance. Who's gonna give the innocent ones a second chance? Absolutely nobody. Spider-Man didn't get the privilege to forgive them, to save them. And more ridiculously, he didn't even aware of that, not even a slightest second of his goddamn life. Thus, it is the most confusing part of the whole movie.I'm just an ordinary audience like everyone else. In fact, I do wanna analyze the lens language of it but it simply doesn't have anything to analyze.So, an ordinary movie that's been over praising. That's it,period.\", \"I'm going to be honest here. I went to see the movie only because I wanted to prove the fan theories if there were going to be more than just Tom's spider man or not because the sequel was kinda not hitting ? (but ngl it was obvious that there is going to be more than just 1 Spider-Man actor but I refused to believe so I would get surprised and also so I don't get really disappointed if Toby and Andrew didn't show up). I know that a lot of people hating on Tom's Spider-Man but after this movie you'll love him for how he portrayed Peter out on this. This movie made sobbing the whole time and also really satisfied. I got chills every SECOND of it there are a-lot of scenes that will leave you want to scream til you loose your voice if you are emotionally attached to Spider-Man movies.

Then the equally bizarre \"cure\" to fix them else they die in their real universe makes no sense.

I never have and I probably won't after this one, but something about this movie (probably how great this film was) made me want to write a review.I watched this movie on my birthday (Jan 21 2022) with a few of my friends. Something about watching this movie with friends really makes it better, if you're planning on going solo, don't. Just go with some friends, trust me, it's worth it.Everything about the environment this movie created was awesome. Even before the movie started, you could sense the atmosphere of the people in the theatre to be a sort of 'no matter what, this is gonna be a great movie', and that's coming from people that are literally thought to stay quiet in public settings all their life.The movie itself is nothing short of spectacular. I know that that's not saying much, there are a thousand other reviews here that say the same thing and go more in depth about the movie, but I think no matter how deep you go into it, you're never doing it justice with your words. You simply have to watch it to know how magnificent this movie is. Before I stepped into the theatre I thought it would be as good as Ragnarok or IW, but when I stepped out it's like I forgot those movies even existed.I'm not gonna drag this review out for a long time, for the 3 of you that are reading this, I just want to say that what you felt in the theatre (or going to feel), I felt too.

All of the spidey villains did an amazing job specifically Willem Dafoe and Alfred Molina who brought their \"A\" game after all these years. Andrew and Tobey\\'s performances were so good as well and props to the director and writers for making their entrance so seamless and giving them so much screen-time! I specifically enjoyed Andrew Garfield and felt like he got the redemption that he so deserves after the hate he received from his spiderman movies. Hopefully this film sets ip a possible TASM 3 for Andrew and another Spider-Man 4 for Tobey. The ending of the film was fantastic and reveals how these last 3 movies hace been an origin story for Tom\\'s Spider-Man and how he now has to rely on his own wit rather than the Avengers.

The whole build up to this film evolved around Spider-Man fans wanting the old Spideys back. I\\'ve got to say I was one of these people, from the start I believed that despite any of the flaws that the film might potentially have (whether is was a big or minor flaw) it would be saved by the audiences excitement of Tobey and Andrew coming through the multiverse\\'s portals.StoryOne of the things that I have a problem with about this film is the story within it. I came into the film as a fan of Spider-Man, not the MCU and the multiverse within it and if you aren\\'t a fan of this, like me, then the whole story will appear very confusing. The way in which Dr Strange can access the multiverse through his \"magic\" just doesn\\'t sit right with me, it takes away from the \"friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man\" that we once loved. Like the original Spider-Man trilogy and the two amazing Spider-Man films, this film and version of Spider-Man isn\\'t in its own independent world, which isn\\'t necessarily a problem, however all that goes on within the multiverse is very overwhelming for one to comprehend, especially for a child to understand. I would honestly rate this storyline as possibly the worst of every Spider-Man I\\'ve watched. I didn\\'t enjoy homecoming and far from home too much, but the stories were a lot more simplistic and still somewhat felt like your friendly neighbourhood Spider-Man, without the overloading hassle of the MCU and the multiverse.Were they all worth it?Looking back at the movie, I view all the villains as quite pointless in ways, all of them had their own story lines in their original films and had a more than satisfactory ending. This brings in the question of why they\\'re in this? It\\'s because of what the people wanted to see despite any ending that they already had, it\\'s completely nostalgic! Some of the most iconic Spidey lines and actions from the old films were performed by Tobey and Andrew, it\\'s exactly what the people wanted! Despite my love for Tobey Maguire and his version of Spider-Man, I honestly didn\\'t feel like he needed to be in the film, his story was complete. He ended his trilogy by making up with Mary Jane with the final hug we saw in Spider-Man 3. It would\\'ve made more sense to have Andrew Garfield in the film however, as his films were far from complete, the amazing Spider-Man 2 literally ended with a cliffhanger before the battle with rhino. And honestly, I think I would\\'ve preferred him to compete his trilogy than feature in this film. These two iconic Spider-Man actors were only in the film because of the revenue it would bring in. They obviously didn\\'t spend much time over the script writing because they knew despite any criticism this film would have, it would make a lot of sales. To put it into context, these two older versions of Peter Parker seemed a little bit off their personality from their retrospective films, and I\\'ve got to say, I wasn\\'t completely satisfied with it, despite my excitement for the nostalgia.ReflectionMy honest opinion about this film remains the same, of course I loved every moment I saw Tobey and Andrew, but the scriptwriting was quite frankly the worst I\\'ve see from a Spider-Man film. A lot of people were blinded by this due to the excitement levels of seeing the old Spideys back. And I beg to ask myself how people honestly thought Spider-Man 3 and the amazing Spider-Man 2 were too \"cluttered\" because a lot of this film was full of useless scenes and interactions between the characters. As I\\'m trying to be an unbiased fan of Spider-Man, I\\'m overall disappointed with the film in general, despite my excitement levels.', \"This had everything - action, comedy emotions the full package !!!

We knew multiverse stories were coming and 'Wandavision' hinted at it a bit but didn't go there and 'Loki' explored it even further, but the first MCU movie to really crack into the multiverse concept winds up being this Spider-Man film. It was an inspired idea to not only bring in villains from previous Spider-Man films, but also to bring in the Spider-Men as well so we get Tom Holland fighting alongside Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield. The multiverse angle is, without a doubt, the huge selling point of this film.What I am not too keen on is how they constructed the story to get to the multiverse. This film commences after the events of the previous Spider-Man film where Mysterio outed Spider-Man as Peter Parker. Peter winds up going to Doctor Strange who nonsensically agrees to cast a spell to have people forget he is Spider-Man. The spell goes awry and folks from other Spidey universes start filtering in. Then it becomes a battle to corral all the villains with help from the other Spider-Men and render them harmless before sending them back to their universe. Why this is supposed to help them when they go back I honestly don't know, but that is what we are lead to believe. In order to restore the universe Peter allows Strange to complete the spell having everyone forget who he is. This has the benefit of sending all the multiversal characters back to their appropriate home, but also leaves Parker in a very odd space at the end of the film with no Aunt May, and no friends and no Avengers/Stark support which Holland's Spider-Man has had throughout his entire run in the MCU. The semantics of that Doctor Strange spell baffle me more than anything, but like most comic book logic it is something you are just supposed to believe, embrace and move on. This does set up Holland's Spider-Man for more films in which he is finally more solely Spider-Man and not a child of the Avengers or Tony Stark which will be nice to see when the next film gets off the ground, and while Parker ends this film in a lonely, dark place I suspect it is only a matter of time before Peter's friends get their memories back. This film also serves as a fitting springboard to the next MCU film where Doctor Strange will be doing his own multiverse story. It was also nice to see them bring back Charlie Cox as Matt Murdock showing up here in what only amounts to a brief cameo but we can anticipate seeing much more of him in the future. This film is fun and energetic and a wild ride and eye popping in its ambitious scope. It is amazing to think from a production standpoint that they were actually able to pull it off.... Avengers assemble indeed. It is more like Spidey alums assemble. Story issues aside this was still a wonderful movie to experience that succeeded on more than a few levels.Eric's Grade: B.\", 'Every now and again a blockbuster is born. Well done Marvel for a truly original concept which was fantastically directed. I found myself not being lost in the blur of CGI as I have in previous recent Marvel productions. All of the A listers should be commended for their acting. What a great way for the cinematic experience to start for 2022.\\n                \\n                    3 out of 4 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Usually my opinion on a film will change over the following days proceeding my original viewing, In the case of No Way Home my feelings towards the film have remained largely the same since I stepped out of the screening.My expectations were high, very high. Did it live up to these expectations? Yes, I think it did, a remarkable accomplishment. Overall, I had a great time here, a really great time in fact. Let\\'s be honest, it was predictable, messy and even contrived at points. But looking from a purely \"entertaining\" standpoint, No Way Home achieves what it sets out to do tremendously.As mentioned, there are plenty of flaws, you could nit-pick for days. The film suffers from mild pacing issues around the beginning and particularly irritating plot points powered by infuriatingly stupid character moments. An obvious example can be found with Doctor Strange, which, without going off to much on a tangent, is by far the worst character in the film. His dialogue is repeatedly cringe inducing and he is just plain idiotic. Why wouldn\\'t he discuss anything about the spell with Peter beforehand? It\\'s almost as if all of his actions are purely to propel the plot.A problem I have with almost all Marvel films is their lack of identity, their lack of artistic integrity and mind-numbingly boring aesthetic. To me, for a long time now, they have simply felt like factory films. Acting as a cash cow to be milked at least twice a year. No Way Home succeeds by breaking away from this mould. This is largely thanks to its creative cinematography and directing in many scenes, the action specifically is shot exceptionally well which helps massively to enhance the movement of Spider Man and the power of attacks being hurled back at force between the characters.One slight flaw I found to be noticeable was the varied quality of performances. For the most part they were very good, Tom Holland really got a chance to show off his talent and Dafoe steals the show as he usually does. But I wasn\\'t really that impressed with Jamie Foxx and I really wish they gave Tobey a lot more to do here. He\\'ll always be my favourite representation of Spider Man however he was being noticeably overshadowed by Andrew Garfield.Apart from a few rather minor details in the grand scheme of things, I really enjoyed my time with No Way Home. I hope this acts as a stepping stone for Marvel because this was a very promising improvement so they best not throw it away.', 'Exiting movie and very fun fun like it like it very noice peple in the film ja ja very nice.

And the movies was weak at being emotional and the plot was very light hearted. But, this one is a perfect spiderman movie. It shows the consequences of being spiderman, as the green goblin says in this movie. \"No good deed goes unpunished.\" And spiderman is a superhero that works alone and makes his costume on his own. This movie showed that even though almost for the half of the movie it relied on stark tech suits like the upgraded suit, and the iron spider suit. Also, peter meeting other spidermen and learning from them was really awesome. Even though the first 1 hour of the movie was very messy and has a very cheap plot, I believe this was the perfect spiderman movie.', \"When you link the past of childhood with the present and the future, we say that it is something unusual. That's how we felt in Spider-Man No Way Home. The Marvel movie series always makes us feel something special emotionally and psychologically. This is how we feel in this movie. At first, when Peter Parker's secret was revealed, he wanted to fix his image in front of society after society know that he was the murderer of Mysterio. He wants to get his friends who are not guilty of Spider Man's actions to go to the university from which they were rejected because they are Peter Parker's friends. And then he went to Doctor Strange to help him that the whole world forget that Peter Parker is Spider Man. And here the amazing events began. Multiverse have been opened and everyone who knows Peter Parker has come to Peter Parker to take revenge on him. Bad guys we've known since childhood, Peter Parker the first, Peter Parker the second, and the third seeing them together fighting bad guys as if they were brothers is something I wished for ever since Spiderman appeared with the Avengers and here it is. What's sadder in the movie when May died and Peter Parker's reaction was this scene in which the director knew how to make people cry from a lot of sadness. Also when we saw Tobey Maguire, it was a more than wonderful scene, a scene that made us cry with a lot of joy. Events in which there is no boredom, the movie is more than wonderful in all respects. The soundtrack with the events and the battles with the bad guys is more than wonderful. Peter Parker's second scene when he saves M. G and does what he couldn't do is more than amazing scene. I hope we see another series where we see the three Spiderman together again. Finally, the end of the movie was realistic and a little sad, but it was a realistic ending and a prelude to the new Doctor Strange movie. I advise you to watch this movie immediately, thank you.\", 'Best spider movie no way home compare to far from home and homecoming but winner is no way Home because No way home doctor strange character act this movie.', 'It is worth of every single money you pay to see it.

First, despite the fact that they mentioned they did spells for the worst reasons such as forgetting parties, I still did not find Dr. Strange's action of assisting kids for college admission through reality warping magic convincing. It simply does not fit with Stephen the arrogant genius's characteristics.Second, Electro should not be in the film because he never knew Spider Man's identity, and third, I'm not sure how the forget spell works (small spoiler), and after seeing the film, I have a lot more concerns about it.None of this matters now that the second half has begun and our school spirit has returned.

This big adventure with Spider-Man offers emotions, heart, humor and great fan service. Thats for the people who Haven\\'t seen the movie. Now for spoilers.SPOILERS!!Spider-Man: No way home, in my opinion, is fan service done right. Firstly, lets talk about the villains. Sandman and the Lizard were useless, but, I would be lying if I didn\\'t enjoy their banter with the other villains in the movie. Surprisingly, Electro was a massive improvement over TASM 2, he seems like a guy I can be friends with tbh. Other then the electric powers and being evil thing. Alfred Molina\\'s Doc Ock was great in this movie, And I love how he\\'s a hero in the end. That was a theory I had while watching the trailers and I was so happy when he did become a hero in the end (even if it was a short amount of time). But the best villain is hands down, Willem Dafoe\\'s Green Goblin. Green Goblin was amazing in this movie, Willem Dafoe\\'s performance really enhanced this character in the movie, Green Goblin also was actually intimidating in the film. When Tom\\'s Peter kept punching Norman, and he just laughs maniacally, chills down my spine. Alright, enough with the villains, lets get into the really good stuff. TOBEY AND ANDREW ARE HERE!! And it isn\\'t a \"Hey, remember that guy?\" Type thing, the movie actually develops them after they\\'re films. Mostly Andrew (that redemption scene was amazing btw) and Tobey even had a bit of redemption when saving Norman from being killed by Tom\\'s Peter with his glider. (It was also a nice callback in a way from Spider-Man 2002) and hearing that Tobey\\'s Peter made it work with his MJ after the events of Spider-Man 3 just made me very happy. And seeing the 3 Spider-men working together at the end made my inner child scream out of excitement in the theater. This film not only made me smile, it also made me tear up a bit, from Aunt May\\'s death to Andrew saving MJ, it was to good. I haven\\'t teared up while watching a movie since I saw Endgame in 2019. And the callbacks and references to previous movies just made me grin in the theater. Most notably the \"I\\'m something of a scientist myself\" line. Heck, even the Action was better from the previous 2 MCU Spider-Man movies. It was fast paced, fun, and seeing each villain using their powers in each battle was great. (My favorite ones were the Doctor Strange fight and the apartment fight). And Peter Parker, he does make a dumb choice by letting the villains go into Happy\\'s Apartment, but he did it because he wanted to save them. Thats something Peter would probably do tbh. Tom\\'s Peter Parker suffers real consequences in this movie, The second Aunt May dies, the film goes from lighthearted and fun, to dark and sinister. And the ending, holy crap, that has to be one of the most saddest endings I\\'ve ever seen. Tom\\'s Peter literally has nothing now. Just Spider-Man. No MJ, no Ned, no May, just, Spider-Man. All of that, just to prevent the Multiverse from breaking. And that scene where Tom\\'s Peter goes to MJ after the spell and sees the band-aid on her forehead, and decides not to make her remember, that made me tear up a bit. THATS GOOD DRAMA FOR THE POSSIBLE NEXT SPIDER-MAN TRILOGY (I mean as of editing this review, it has made 1.7 billion dollars. So its highly Sony and Marvel are gonna make another movie). Man, this movie is such a wild ride. A roller-coaster of emotions, comedy and heart. Now, this movie isn\\'t perfect. Especially to people who haven\\'t seen the other Spider-Man movies or grew up with them, and the plot-line is very messy and there are tons of plot holes. But in the end, as A Spider-Man fan who watched all of the Spider-Man movies since I was a kid, this movie is fantastic. It may just be fan service, but it was some damn good fan service. Thank you Marvel and Sony for the greatest Christmas gift I could have ever asked for. I will forever cherish this trilogy.

I'm usually against film/TV being littered with fan service because usually it makes no sense and sometimes is out of character and ruins the consistency. But in this case it just added to the greatness of the movie.This film provides everything: great spider-Man like comedy, epic action sequences, nostalgia and emotional depth that not many MCU films manage to do. The acting was great, especially by Tom Holland, and Willem Dafoe who reprised his role even creepier than before.Obviously Tobey and Andrew's involvement made this movie even better. The on screen interaction between all 3 Spider-Mans and their interactions with respective universe villains are some of films most interesting and cool moments.There were so many references and moments that make it an incredible experience for marvel fans. But it also is an incredible experience for the average audience. This movie had the bar raised high and the immense hype for it made me worry it would not live up to it. But I was wrong. It did.This, on a par with infinity war, is my favourite MCU movie.\", \"I had a great fun day watching this masterpiece getting me back to the old days watching tobey and andrew again, the iconic scene when andrew saved mj i almost cried there, there was some nonsense bad scenes but it's okay for the surprise unexpected ending i think peter parker will take care on himself being a good point on him and on the mcu future spider man movie.\", \"I enjoyed spider-man no way home more than any movie I've seen in 2021. This movie was gorgeous on so many levels, I can't believe they really brought back Tobey Maguire, and Andrew Garfield, I didn't really think they were gonna do it. This movie is truly the live action Spider-Verse movie I've been waiting for. It was good to see Tobey and Andrew return as Spider-Man, this is the best spider-man movie imo. Doctor Strange was an outstanding supporting character in the film, I loved all the spider-man villains reprising their roles. Willem Defoe was very intimidating which made his performance incredible, he was definitely one of the reasons this movie was so epic. I'm excited to see what they will do next now that Tom Hollands Spider-Man is all alone now that Ned and MJ have no memory of him, I am curious to see how the three of them will reconnect if they make a fourth film. Good job Marvel and Sony, No way Home was a blast!!!\", 'Feel like Avengers End Game🙃......... What a Story. Its great Story line, great VFX, great Acting.. Every Characters Play Amazing Role ...

It beautifully and logically connects three eras of Spider-Man movies into one complete package of surprises, action, thrill and the most important of them -emotion. The dialogues are very properly crafted to bring as sense of continuity from the three eras of Spider-Man movies. The top cast of the movie have really lived up to their fame and made the movie come to life with their splendid acting skills and their hard-work. The CGI and VFX of this movie are more than what a Marvel fan desires. The job of completing this incredibly ambitious project was indeed a difficult task and since the film-makers are humans after all so plot-holes were inevitable. Overall, this movie is like heavenly manna for those who were in the hunger for the best Spider-Man movie.Features of this film:-\\nActing- 5/5\\nAction- 4/5\\nBackground Music- 4/5\\nLogic- 3/5\\nSurprises- 8/5\\nEmotion- 5/5\\nPlot- 3/5Further in-depth analysis:-\\nComing to the purpose of the movie which makes it what fans call \\'epic\\', \\'blockbuster\\', \\'masterpiece\\', \\'thunderbuster\\', etc.Spider-Man: No Way Home was the medium by which Marvel and Sony not only corrected the mistakes of Tobey Maguire\\'s Spider-Man and Andrew Garfield\\'s Spider-Man in their respective universes but also did justice to Tom Holland\\'s Spider-Man\\'s character arc.From the time of Tom Holland\\'s Spider-Man\\'s debut he had been living in the shadow of others which did not make him realise his own true potential. To be frank, I did not even feel like he was Spider-Man because the main-point of being Spider-Man (besides having spider-powers) was to have personal problems and keeping your identity secret even from your colleagues and not be dependent on someone else which Tom\\'s Spider-Man constantly failed to do.It\\'s a pleasure to see Marvel and Sony trying to correct their mistakes and making Tom\\'s Spider-Man realise that his days of staying in others shadows are gone. It is time for him to start from zero and stand on his own feet because \"with great power comes great responsibilities.\"', \"The most exciting and exhilarating Spider Man film ever. Gives chills and nostalgic feel. Spiderman is not a character, it's a feeling and the director has curated a movie with such love and bought spidermans from other movies in a good manner that it wins heart.

SpoilersMarvel Phase 4 gets a turbo boost with this entry. Peter Parker has been outed and to save him & his friends from public scrutiny he finds Dr Strange who casts a spell to make people forget Peter Parker is Spiderman. Things don\\'t go to plan and the \"multi-verse\" is unleashed causing havoc as anyone from other universes pops up.This allows characters from other Spiderman movies to come along for the ride including Dr Octavious, Electro, Green Goblin. Willem Difoe steals the show in these sequences.I said spoilers right so stop reading if your going to see this movie.With the multi-verse open the cream that sits atop the movie is the appearance of Tobey Maguire & Andrew Garfield as alternative Spidey\\'s. What I really liked here is that they aren\\'t just cameos, they feel part of the movie and they give it great heart and feeling. The major fight scene with all 3 Spider-Man really is a comic book readers wet dream!One of the highlights is a conversation about where Tobeys web fluid comes from. Hilarious.Back to the movie itself, it tries to be great and has great ideas but in the end it\\'s just Spiderman and it\\'s villains fighting it out. Don\\'t get me wrong, it\\'s good fun and an enjoyable movie.Tom Holland is a really good actor and is great in this. By far my favourite. Tobey was good in the first one and Andrew was ok but let down by poor movies and in particular it\\'s villains.The multiverse is set up well so will be interesting to see where they go with it?Make sure you stay right to the end credits of which there are 2.

It felt tied together. There is not a part I wouldn't have put in - even as saddened as I am about Aunt May dying and everyone forgetting Peter (big ouch) but honestly I think that even as sad as those moments truly were - it makes the movie to what it is. And I mean we did have a lot of redemption in it! Andrew for gods sake! I am so happy that they decided to also show his emotions when he saved MJ. Really good choice. I also really wanna shoutout the comedy part of the movie (which is all of it) I really freaking laughed in this movie. So good.Definitely will be watching it again when it comes out.

I should probably go to bed. It\\'s late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it\\'s so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it\\'s not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter\\'s wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone\\'s youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister\\'s wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. \"Citizen Kane\" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did \"Gone With the Wind\" or \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". \"The Godfather\" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement.', \"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers.

Tell me a movie that has had more parodies spinned off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can\\'t. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable.The horse\\'s head, the scene of Brando running with his groceries, the coffee shop scene, \"I\\'ll give him an offer he can\\'t refuse\" and countless other scenes and quotes from this movie have become a part of our culture. These scenes and lines have been recycled over and over again in comedies, commercials, etc. that it is impossible to avoid the greatness of The Godfather. The Godfather is like a disease once you see it you fall in love with it. I don\\'t know if it is the greatest movie ever but it is definitely the most iconic film ever made.', 'The Godfather is one of the few films in which I personally did not find any significant weakness even after many viewings. From the direction, to the acting, to the storyline, to the score, The Godfather has the word classic written all over, and it really is not much of a surprise that it is now considered by many one of the top five movies of all time. Perhaps when it comes to cinematic techniques The Godfather has not been as revolutionary as Citizen Kane, but its influence on motion pictures is comparable. Rarely a movie has defined or re-defined a genre as much as this one did for \"gangster movies\", but its influence goes well beyond that.The Godfather\\'s influence has been so big through the years that elements of it can be found in virtually every \"organized crime film\" nowadays; almost every comedy featuring a gangster in the last few years has spoofed something in The Godfather. The Italian-American old mobster a-la Don Vito Corleone has become one of the most established figures in the public\\'s imagination.But to say that The Godfather is simply \"influential\" is to diminish its true qualities, and so is to describe it simply as \"a movie about gangsters\". The Mafia is certainly the main focus the story revolves around (despite the fact that the word is never mentioned), but although the movie never tries to forcedly insert separate subjects it contains an amount of psychological and social subtexts that cannot be overlooked. Considerations on how the social environments changes us, on how moral values appear different from different point of views, on how violence can destroy a human soul, and on how power can corrupt an individual are deeply blended into a story that stays practically always true to complete realism, and the result is a picture of astonishing efficacy and believability.As good as the direction and the story are, it would be unfair not to consider the major role that the actors\\' performances had in the cinematic triumph that was The Godfather. Praised by many as the best cast to ever appear in an American movie, all the cast in The Godfather succeeds in portraying complex, three-dimensional characters without ever making a slip. The exceptional portrayals of Don Vito and Michael Corleone respectively by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, the performances by Robert Duvall, James Caan and Diane Keaton as Tom Hagen, Santino Corleone and Kay Adams, the ruthless Virgil Sollozzo played by Al Lettieri -- as well as more than a few other roles -- are all perfect for the movie, and they all succeed in making us believe these are real people, not just actors. We are not watching a central character and a bunch of incomplete figures that revolve around him: although Michael Corleone is the character that gets the most screen time, everybody is the center of this world his own way. The movie makes it possible for the viewers to identify with different characters and to observe how their personality and story fits in, and it does it much more effectively than many bloated multiple-storyline movies that came out in the last few years.The movie opens on the wedding of Don Vito Corleone\\'s daughter, Connie (Talia Shire). Don Corleone is a powerful man, and it was not without the use of violence that he achieved this position during the course of his life. The wedding scene gives a perfect setting of where and how the Don\\'s power extends; from the regular worker in a neighborhood, to the immensely popular singer, to the friends in politics and right to the ruthless killer, Don Corleone has links to people ready to ask him favors and to pay him back. Some are trustworthy, some are not, but thanks to his intelligence and intuit the Don can almost always distinguish the two.However, this is 1946, times are changing, and to many of the younger people working in the crime business, Don Corleone\\'s ideas are becoming obsolete. The Don believes that the new trend in the business, narcotics, is too dangerous and the families dealing with it would eventually end up self-destroying; while his family had deals in alcohol and gambling for a long time, part of the Government and law enforcement was ready to close one eye. Drugs are another thing.To this day, Don Corleone was able to keep things together while maintaining his economic and political power, but things will brutally change when a powerful drug dealer name Sollozzo enters the picture. The refusal of Don Corleone to cooperate with Sollozzo, and a weakness immediately spotted by the latter, will ignite a war that will cost many lives, and that will see Michael Corleone, Vito\\'s younger son and the one who never wanted to take part in the family business, lose his \"innocence\" and transform into a gangster as ruthless as the people he initially stood up against.I purposely decided not to spoil much about the plot because I believe that the film is perfectly enjoyed without knowing anything in advance, and -- believe it or not -- there are still quite a lot of people who have never seen this movie. There are multiple scenes that manage to create an incredible tension, various twists, and although like any other masterpiece The Godfather can be watched knowing the whole story beforehand and still be a phenomenal experience, I believe it is always a pleasure to see it for the first time and enjoy its multiple climaxes. Besides, to outline such complicated characters and such an emotionally intense story in a short review like this one would be inadmissible.There has been much speculation on how the events in The Godfather novel written by Mario Puzo, the book the film is based on, could be an exposé of true facts. Many believe that the character of Johnny Fontane , for instance, was based on Frank Sinatra\\'s real life, and many of the other characters were modeled after real people. I won\\'t go into that: frankly, I have no idea whether these voices are reliable, although the Frank Sinatra reference seems obviously quite believable.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn\\'t need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.', 'One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema.\\n                \\n                    136 out of 167 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox\", 'Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you\\'re never bored. It\\'s wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It\\'s also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (\"I\\'ll make him an offer he can\\'t refuse\") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she\\'s married into. The look on her face is perfect.This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing.', \"This is a masterpiece. A timeless masterpiece. Initially, I didn't like this film all that much - I found it rather over-hyped and boring. This was until the advent of DVD, which gave me the feature I needed for this sort of film: subtitles. Once I switched them on and heard (read) every last word of Brando's ramblings and other characters ramblings, I grew a true appreciation for this epic.To make a true epic, you need all of three following ingredients working in near perfect harmony. For screenwriters who come across this, take the following pointers on board: 1) Contrasting Characters: Good films have some character distinction, but most fall rather flat because the core of each character is the same.Of course, there are exceptions to rule (ie... where you want mono-tonal characters... aka matrix; or where you want outlandish contrasts... aka The Fifth Element), but ultimately, this is what makes films deep, meaningful and grand. Consider the contrasts between the Don's children. Michael is rather cool, rational and collected, whereas Sonny is more hot-headed, spontaneous and simple minded. But simply having these contrasts is not nearly enough. What you really need to do is to develop these characters - place them in situations - and then dwell on how their character impacts on the situation they're put in. The Godfather is a terrific example of how to pull this off. While many try to do this in screenplays, most lose the plot and create character obscurities that stretch credibility.2) Transformation: The central character(s) must undergo a transformation, resulting in them being almost unrecognizable by the end of the film. By putting them into situations, the character's character must not only influence the outcome of the situation; it must also have a lasting impact on the character. Consider Michael at the wedding and compare that to the Michael we see at the end of the film. Again, many films try, but most fail because they come up with unreal (literally, not praisingly) or simply moronic transformations (eg, Wall Street).3) Patience: Men in Black 2 was an astounding film for one simple reason - it was an entire film squashed into about 70 minutes. It was not much longer than an episode of ER or Buffy. I certainly hope the new goal of Hollywood isn't to make films as short as possible.All the great ones spend time - time developing characters, family life, growth, patience with the story telling in general. This is the key (provided that the story isn't mind-numbingly boring). Dances with Wolves, Heat.. and so on are very patient but top-class films. While studios may be lukewarm on the idea of longer films, they are worth it if you have a ripper story to base it on.I feel that this film has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.\", 'Up until today, I haven\\'t bothered to review \"The Godfather\". After all, everyone pretty much knows it\\'s one of the greatest films ever made. It\\'s #2 on IMDb\\'s Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what\\'s one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it\\'s time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn\\'t watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it\\'s 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I\\'ll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it\\'s violent and nasty in spots--but it\\'s also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it\\'s received.My advice is that instead of just watching \"The Godfather\" and \"The Godfather: Part II\", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience.', \"Rather than concentrating on everything that is great about The Godfather, a much easier way for me to judge its quality is on what is bad about it. Almost every film has something that I don't like about it, but I can honestly say that I wouldn't change anything about The Godfather. There is nothing weak about it and nothing that stands out as bad. That's why it gets ten out of ten.This is one of those films that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier. The acting from everyone involved is great, Marlon Brando comes across perfectly as the head of the family, and James Caan and Al Pacino are excellent as his sons. The soundtrack by Nino Rota is also very memorable, bringing back memories of the film every time I hear it. The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the film is the definition of a great epic.The film is pretty shocking in the way every death occurs almost instantaneously, and as it spans ten years so many different things happen and every minute of it is great entertainment. It's a well-made and entertaining film that is only the first part of a trilogy, but it stands on its own as a wonderful film in its own right. If you haven't seen it, what are you waiting for? This was one acclaimed film that didn't disappoint.\", '\"The Godfather\" simply put, is one of the greatest films of all time. The script is thee best I\\'ve ever read. The direction is flawless. The acting may very well have the best ensemble cast in any movie I\\'ve ever seen or will ever see. It\\'s also one of the most precise and intricate films I\\'ve ever come across as writer, Mario Puzo brings out some of the most hidden and guarded secrets of the underground world ever captured on film. Watching \"The Godfather,\" is like watching cinematic art. Francis Ford Coppola\\'s direction is what brings this film, that\\'s so ambitious and so grand, down to earth with precision direction as he handles each and every scene with such care. The film starts with a black screen and an opening monologue from an undertaker. As the man starts talking about honor, family, respect, and justice we are pulled right in on his luminous eyes as he stands in near darkness. He begs for justice since the American system has failed him. He goes to Don Corleone (Marlon Brando) for justice. Don Vito is the man of power. He\\'s the one who pulls all the strings and watches his puppets dance from behind the stage and out of sight; untouchable, or so we think. Some of the greatest moments in the film- and very intentional to show the distinguishable difference between Michael and Vito- are of Vito crying over his son, Sonny\\'s (James Caan), death. When Michael learns of the news, he has little reaction. Two of the most emotionally powerful scenes in the film are from the cause of a loved one that has died long before he should have, and they come from Brando. As Vito stands over the body of his son he nearly breaks down. There is clash of feelings between the two men that are never conflicting, but compared. The film opens during the wedding of Don Vito\\' daughter, Connie (Talia Shire), and we see just how strong the bond of family really is. You have the family dancing with each other, drinking, laughing, and sitting next to each other to show how close they are, then we see some of the outsiders such as the Barzini family, and surprisingly Michael (Al Pacino) along with his girlfriend Kay (Diane Keaton) on the outskirts without much interaction. Michael seems almost out of place as if he is the adopted son and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is more apart of the family than he is. His opening words are to Kay, and they include, \"That\\'s my family, Kay. That\\'s not me.\" We get the feeling that Michael\\'s nearly ashamed of the stigma that goes along with his last name: This is what makes Al Pacino\\' role- significantly- the hardest performance in the entire film to portray. He\\'s the one doing all the heavy lifting as he has to go from outsider and completely against the family\\'s actions and businesses to, by films end, head of the family. Brando has the teary eyed moments that actors live for, but Michael is too cold for that. Never for a second as he gradually comes to power do we think this turn is ridiculous or laughable, and in lesser hands it very easily could have been. The final act of the film is loaded with plot points as decisions are made left and right as the film becomes visually and emotionally captivating. As the film draws to an end, Michael has gained half of the power of the family and makes most of the decisions. He\\'s treated, not with respect, but as an outsider, too high ranking for his experience. The Corleone family is on the brink of disaster and losing everything, yet we never get that feeling. We see the two leader\\'s confidence and we keep our confidence in them, even if the other family members doubt their decisions. Michael goes to Las Vegas and makes Moe Greene an offer he can\\'t refuse. Then he refuses. This is Pacino\\' shinning moment in the film. There\\'s no screaming or the hoopla that goes along with his name. After he treats Moe Greene like utter garbage, Fredo (John Cazale) get\\'s upset and starts barking at him. Coppola is perfectly on his game here, too, as we watch from Fredo\\'s height, looking down on Michael who sits in a chair as he coldly looks up with his radiating eyes, that have so much going on behind them, and simply says, \"Fredo, don\\'t ever take sides with anyone against family again. Ever.\"That\\'s some serious foreshadowing for the second film, and only after watching the second film can you go back and appreciate what Pacino and Coppola pulled off in this scene; Cazale too. We have no idea how serious Michael is. These are some of the stepping stones that make Michael\\'s change believable. He\\'s not quite his father- Vito has a soft spot for his children (admittedly so)- as he\\'s capable of turning on anyone and using the line, \"It\\'s strictly business\" when it comes to family issues. Michael\\'s sister, Connie, calls him a \"cold hearted bastard\" at the end of the film. It\\'s hard to find better superlatives than that, yet we still love him. The interesting thing about Pacino\\' performance is that he doesn\\'t sugarcoat it. He doesn\\'t try to make the audience love him. He plays the character as the character should be played. That\\'s the sign of great writing; great acting; and great directing since we could have very easily seen someone try to make him likable. This crew just presents the character with all his flaws and let\\'s us decide if we love him or hate him. Its films like \"The Godfather,\" that made me wish I had amnesia, so I could feel the same heart pounding moments over and over again.', 'This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.\\n                \\n                    677 out of 996 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Since its release in 1972, \"The Godfather\" has been highly praised by fans universally. It\\'s extremely hard for a person who has never seen \"The Godfather\" without having high expectations because millions of people, maybe more have been talking about how wonderful it is. But as a film critic who has seen the movie several times and has read the novel that it was based on by Mario Puzo, this movie really deserves the credibility it gets. It really is that special. The film is a gripping epic that indulges the viewer with plenty of unsuspecting twists and a plot that works in a multitude of dimensions. The mobster\\'s depicted here face many trials and tribulation that involve marriage, favours, family struggles, turncoats, tragic events, violence and rigor mortis.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head patriarch and kingpin of his esteemed enterprise is acquainted to at his daughter\\'s wedding, which is a special occurrence in Italian tradition (Sicilian in particular) where the father of the bride is to refrain from offering the groom any special favours. His representatives showing their signs of respect towards the Don are featured in the opening scenes are told through their ways of personal address and greeting regimentations. The Don is to be treated with respect and dignity, a man who follows his own frame of mind to what is fair, and will likely deny any means of avenge. As an example, if anyone was to fondle with his daughter in any kind of way grounds for murder. It\\'s not revenge, as long as your daughter\\'s still breathing.There are also numerous facets that indicate how not so respected the Don really is. Vito comes from the old school of Mafia, and can be labeled as a \"Moustache\" Pete. For one, unlike his adversaries, he refuses to get involved with drugs or smuggling for that matter. It this is much to the chagrin of other rival mob units in the state of New York. The violence is described disturbingly as nothing personal, it\\'s just business. The philosophy behind this organized crime is chilling, but quite convincing. The violence is creepily accepted and sometimes happens all of the sudden. Suddenly, the Corleone enterprise falls on its foundations, and it\\'s up to the next generation to restore the family so it could be ranked as the top of the best mob families.The cast features a myriad of talented performers each playing their respective roles flawlessly. The top stars like Brando as Vito, James Caan as the hot-tempered Sonny, Al Pacino as the likable Michael, John Cazale as middle-sibling Fredo, Robert Duvall as mob attorney Tom Hagen, Richard Castellano as Clemenza, Abe Vigoda as Tessio and Diane Keaton as Kay Adams are what I may have expected what the characters from Puzo\\'s book look like physically. Even the smaller roles deserve special credit. The performances were absolutely amazing. The characters in the film compliment the characters from the novel and it is mainly due to the physical structuring and the carefully planned interpretation.The novel this movie was based on by Mario Puzo deserves praise in itself. Even though this movie was a fictional, there are a lot of authentic features that make every scene and every chapter to be real. I guess people when they think of mob bosses they visualize a supreme Don, sitting in his chair with a long facial expression contemplating with endless level-headedness and leadership. \"The Godfather\" is a marvel from both the film and the novel and it is hard to determine what medium is the better of the two.If there is one thing that the book is better would be character development. Al Pacino\\'s Michael Corleone is a more prominent character in the novel than in the movie. Michael\\'s transformation in the movie is at times a bit rushed, while in the book it\\'s handled more gradual. The other character Luca Brasi played by Lenny Montana was a more vital character in the novel, which while he was an ally to the Corleone clan, is marked as a threatening adversary with a dark and dreary secret. In the movie comes across as a big oaf, and not as scary. It\\'s also nice that some of the smaller characters from the novel have engaging back stories like Captain McCluskey (Sterling Hayden). But that\\'s good for the novel\\'s sake, while the film would result in overdone detailing.Overall, \"The Godfather\" is one of the greatest films ever made. Thanks mainly to the crew for creating a well-structured setting that compliments nicely to the characters, the script and most importantly, the direction of Francis Ford Coppola. Hats off to the cinematography from Gordon Willis which is backed nicely by the elegant score from Nino Rota and Carlo Savina. This film truly defines the words \"required viewings.\"', \"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10.\", \"Before 'The Godfather' came out in 1972, the gangster genre, chiefly associated with Jimmy Cagney and the film noir style of the forties and fifties, had been in something of a decline. It was, therefore, a brave move for Francis Ford Coppola to attempt a three-hour epic based upon the family life of a Mafia don. The film opens in the immediate post-war period with the wedding of the daughter of Don Vito Corleone. Scenes of the wedding are intercut with scenes showing Don Vito himself in his study, granting favours and dispensing a crude form of justice as though he were an absolute monarch. We soon learn, however, that times are changing, even in the world of organised crime. Don Vito's empire has been based upon gambling, illicit liquor sales and prostitution. Other Mafia families, however, are eager for the profits to be made from drugs, and Corleone receives a proposal from a drug dealer named Sollozzo that the Corleone clan should join him in exploiting the narcotics market. Corleone refuses, ostensibly for business reasons, but it is made clear that his real objections to narcotics derive from his personal code of honour. Sollozzo, offended, orders an attempt to be made on Corleone's life. This fails, but Corleone is left seriously injured.The focus now shifts to the younger generation. Don Vito has three sons, Santino ('Sonny'), Fredo and Michael, and an adopted son, Tom Hagen. These four have contrasting characters. Sonny is hot-headed and impetuous, Fredo weak, Tom cautious and moderate. Michael, the youngest, loves his family, but initially wants to play no part in their criminal enterprises. Recently returned from the war, his ambitions are to qualify as a lawyer and to settle down in a respectable life with his Anglo-Saxon wife-to-be, Kay. The attempt on his father's life, however, persuades Michael that his first loyalty is to the family, and he agrees to be part of a revenge attack on Sollozzo and Captain McCluskey the corrupt policeman who is on his payroll. There follows a brutal cycle of revenge, as each killing is avenged by another murder. The film's emphasis on family ties, honour and vengeance recall the revengers' tragedies of the Shakespearean and Jacobean theatre. Coppola does seem to be aiming for a Shakespearean grandeur. Don Vito, the ageing monarch whose powers slip away is reminiscent of King Lear, Michael, a good man corrupted by power, of Macbeth (a comparison which will become even more apt in the later episodes of the trilogy). There is also something of Hamlet in Michael and Sonny's resolve to avenge their father. Such an ambitious film requires acting of a very high order if it is to seem credible, but Coppola was able to draw upon some of the best performances of the seventies. To my mind, this was Marlon Brando's last great role (I have never cared much for 'Apocalypse Now' and loathed 'Last Tango in Paris'), but it was one that he made the most of. His Don Vito is both terrifying and pitiable, part dictator and part lonely old man. His rasping voice (the result of an earlier bullet wound in the throat) conveys both menace and physical weakness. Don Vito may be a bad man, but he is also in a way a magnificent one, and his passing marks the end of an era. If the film was notable for the last of the great Brando, it also saw the birth of a new star. Except perhaps for 'The Godfather Part II', I have never seen Al Pacino give a better performance than he did here, as he portrayed Michael's passage from a 'civilian' (as his brother calls him) to a warlord, from an innocent young idealist to a ruthless killer. Given the length of time that Pacino is on screen, I am surprised that he was only nominated for Best Supporting Actor rather than Best Actor. It would be interesting to speculate who might have won if he and Brando had been in competition for the award. I am even more surprised that Pacino did not win as Best Supporting Actor; Joel Grey's role in 'Cabaret' (which did win) is more showy and a technical tour de force, but it lacks the emotional depth of Pacino's performance. I also greatly admired James Caan's role as the hot-headed Sonny. This is not a perfect film; it has flaws, both artistic and ethical. Artistically, there are places where it tends to drag, particularly after the killings of Sollozzo and McCluskey, and even more so after the killing of Sonny, although it recovers at the ending, which is a highly effective piece of cinema. Ethically, I felt that the film tended to take the characters' world view too much at face value. Don Vito may be a dictator, but he is in his own eyes a benevolent dictator, a man of honour who lives by his own moral code. As others such as Roger Ebert have pointed out, this is a film which views a closed society from the inside; the only outsider is Kay, and her role is a relatively minor one. As a result, we do not get to see the damage that organised crime does to the fabric of society, and the Mafia's own view of itself is never openly challenged. That is not to say, however, that the film is totally amoral. We do see that an ethos of taking revenge can spiral out of control and lead to unforeseen consequences, to the innocent as well as the guilty. This is particularly true of the scenes where Michael takes refuge in Sicily after killing Sollozzo. The dead man's associates track him down, and a bomb meant for him instead kills his innocent young Italian wife Apollonia. Although there may be no overt condemnation of the moral position of the Mafia, there is implied criticism of its bloodier deeds. All the characters, whatever the crimes of which they may be guilty, are careful to pay lip-service to the Catholic Church and its rituals. Throughout the film (indeed, throughout the trilogy as a whole) the traditional ceremonies of the Church form a backdrop to various criminal activities. ('The Godfather' begins with a wedding and ends with a baptism). It seemed to me that Coppola was using these scenes to make an ironic contrast between the values of organised crime and those of Christianity, especially at the end of the film. Michael, already a 'godfather' in the metaphorical sense of a Mafia boss, becomes one in the literal sense of a baptismal sponsor. Shots of him taking vows on behalf of his godchild to reject the works of the devil are intercut with shots of his enemies being gunned down on his orders.Despite my reservations about this film, and although I personally would not have ranked it as my all-time favourite, there can be no denying that it is a film of great power and a milestone in the history of the cinema. 8/10\", 'The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.', \"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants. The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!\", \"Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges.

Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all.\", 'The Godfather deserves to be called the best movie in history, and from my personal point of view, nothing is wrong with it\\n                \\n                    8 out of 9 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?

Don Vito Caroleone\\'s early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn\\'t even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don\\'s younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy', \"It's basically impossible to watch this movie directed by Francis Ford Coppola, without already knowing some of the major themes, motifs, plot twists, within author Mario Puzo's story; due to how popular the film is. Even, if you haven't saw the movie, you probably heard of it. If you had, saw it. You might agree with me, in scope, that this movie is indeed, one of the greatest films ever made. Based off, Mario Puzo's 1969 novel with the same name, The Godfather tells the story of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) on his journey, from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss, during the criminal drug wars of the 1940/early 1950s. Without spoiling the movie, too much, I found that a lot of critics, overpraise Marlon Brando's work in this, a way too much. Don't get me wrong, Marlon Brando does deserve, a lot of credit for making his character, the patriarch Vito Corleone, so iconic. I just don't believe, that he deserve, the Oscar for Best Actor, that year. In my opinion, Al Pacino should had be nominated & won. After all, Michael is pretty much, the main character, not Vito. Also, Pacino is the one actor that kept the movie, going, with his great range of emotional. Brando show-what disappears, toward the middle of the film. If any, Brando deserve to win, Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards, because Brando's acting is secondary to that of Pacino. It's not personality, it's only business. Besides that, the acting throughout the film was well-performed, from all the actors. I just wish, there wasn't much, many characters. It was so hard to keep track of each one. Some actors, worth noting for their performance are James Caan as Michael's hot-headed brother, Sonny Corleone, Robert Duvall as Irish lawyer, Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Michael's girlfriend, Kay Adams & last, John Cazale as Michael's weaker brother, Fredo Corleone. As much, as I despise, certain gangster films. There was something, likable with these characters. Yes, they do, horrible stuff, but you can't help, feeling bad for them. Indeed, keep your friends close, your enemies closer. Not only was the film had gifted actors, but it was very well-shot. I love, how the film used doors, as a way to symbolize, the different between family life, and 'the family life'. A great example of this, was the last few minutes of the film in which Kay finds out, the truth nature about Michael. It's a crucial theme of the film. The five families are essentially living the American dream with specific ideals that America at the time greatly treasured. One could easily see this as a deconstruction or even an attack on the idea of the American Dream. So it was no surprise that the families met inside a Federal Reserve Bank. Talk about smart! I also like, how the movie has this stark bleak look to it. All the colors in the film, looks so muted, as if to say, this gangster film was indeed shot in early 1940s, technicolor. I like how, clever, the filmmaker was, when using bright colors. Most of the only bright color, used in the film, was orange. It was used as mostly an item, like a fruit symbol. It representing sin, and greed. It's as if it was the forbidden fruit, in the bible. It was also, used as a sexual way to show impending judgment. Everybody that got near it, end up, dying in the film. While, the movie has tons of other symbolism. It's also shroud in darkness and mystery. The movie even has a few film noir inspire scenes, where shadow, become a big factor to show, how shady, the underworld, can be. Vito's daughter's wedding scene shows the best of this. The movie has a lot of violence as well. Scenes like the real horse severed head were pretty gruesome. Still, compare to modern day, gangster movies, the sex, drugs and violence is pretty tame. For the most part, the movie kept to a somewhat classy mode with its subject matter. I do like the editing. The whole baptize sequence was amazing to watch. The pacing for the film is a mixed bag for me. There were some parts of the film that I kinda found boring or out of place, such as the Sicily, Las Vegas & Hollywood scenes. It felt like, I was watching two different films, due to how unfamiliar, each of those scenes, were, when comparing to the New York settling. I just glad, they were very short. The film also drops a lot of the novel's subplots, such as Sonny's mistress, having a large vagina, and having to get surgery on it. Another thing worth cutting is a lot of Johnny Fontane (Al Martino) and Lucy Mancini (Jeannie Linero) scenes. In the novel they both get big story lines nearly the equal of the main storyline with Michael. I'm glad, they cut it out, because it was too jarring. Though one major one, they cut out in this film: Don Vito's youth and rise to power came back, as part of the sequel, 1974's the Godfather: Part II. Happy, that they found, a way to add that, back in. Leave the Fontane BS. Take the cannoli, instead. The film score by Nino Rota was great. You really think of the word 'mafia' when you hear that tune. While, the film doesn't deliberately speak that word, it did expose, what was then, a mostly hidden underworld of Mafia organizations. Overall: While, some big time criminals and even some stars, like Frank Sinatra were against it, and boycott the film, but they couldn't stop the movie, from being made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release. It's a classic.\", \"This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.\\n                \\n                    18 out of 24 found this helpful.\\n                        \\n                            Was this review helpful?
